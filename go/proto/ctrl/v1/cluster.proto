// Package ctrl.v1 provides the Cluster service for multi-cluster deployment orchestration.
//
// The Cluster service enables a central control plane to coordinate deployments and sentinels
// across multiple Kubernetes clusters. Each cluster runs an agent (such as krane) that establishes
// a long-lived watch connection to receive deployment and sentinel configuration events.
//
// This design follows the Kubernetes watch pattern where agents (like kubelet) maintain
// a streaming connection to receive incremental updates, enabling real-time deployment
// orchestration across distributed clusters.

// ClusterService coordinates deployment and sentinel configurations across multiple clusters.
//
// Agents in each cluster establish a watch stream to receive configuration events
// from the control plane. The service streams deployment and sentinel lifecycle events
// (apply, delete) to the appropriate clusters based on their cluster_id and region.
//
// The watch connection is designed to be long-lived with automatic reconnection on failure.
// When an agent reconnects, it should initiate reconciliation to ensure consistency.
