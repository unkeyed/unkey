Zen is a lightweight, minimalistic HTTP framework for Go, designed to wrap the
standard library with just enough abstraction to streamline your development
process—nothing more, nothing less.

## Why "Zen"?
The name "Zen" reflects the philosophy behind the framework: simplicity,
clarity, and efficiency.

- Simplicity: Focus on what matters most—handling HTTP requests and responses
  with minimal overhead.
- Clarity: A thin wrapper that feels natural, staying true to Go's idiomatic
  style.
- Efficiency: Built on Go’s robust standard library, Zen adds no unnecessary
  complexity or dependencies.

## Features
- Built directly on the Go standard library (net/http).
- Thin abstractions for routing, middleware, and error handling.
- No bloat—just the essentials.
- Fast and easy to integrate with existing Go projects.

## Philosophy

Zen is for developers who embrace Go’s simplicity and power. By focusing only
on essential abstractions, it keeps your code clean, maintainable, and in
harmony with Go’s design principles.
