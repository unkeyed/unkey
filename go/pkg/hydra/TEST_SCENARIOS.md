## Notes for Implementation

### Test Organization
- Group related tests into files (e.g., `workflow_execution_test.go`, `worker_coordination_test.go`)
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate for similar scenarios
- Include both unit tests and integration tests
- Use proper setup/teardown for database state
- create helper functions to deduplicate boilerplate
- tests should be short in terms of lines of code if possible and easy to understand.

### Test Data Management
- Use isolated databases for each test
- Clean up test data after each test
- Use realistic but minimal test data
- Consider using test fixtures for complex scenarios

### Test Reliability
- Avoid time-dependent tests where possible
- Use deterministic test data and configurations
- Handle async operations with proper waiting/polling
- Include retry logic for flaky external dependencies

### Performance Considerations
- Consider using separate test suites for different types of tests
- Monitor test execution time and optimize slow tests
