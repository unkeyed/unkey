# Chaos Testing for Hydra Workflow Engine

This document describes the comprehensive chaos testing framework implemented to validate the resilience and reliability of the Hydra workflow engine under extreme failure conditions.

## Overview

Our chaos testing strategy validates system behavior under realistic failure scenarios using complex, multi-step workflows that mirror production workloads. The testing framework progressively introduces failures while monitoring data consistency and recovery capabilities.

## Test Workflows

### 1. Complex Billing Workflow (`ComplexBillingWorkflow`)

**Purpose**: Simulates a realistic billing pipeline with multiple steps, parallel execution, and error handling.

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Customer Validation** (with retry logic)
2. **Parallel Execution**:
   - Calculate invoice amount
   - Fetch usage data
3. **Apply Discounts** (conditional, if amount > $100)
4. **Generate PDF Invoice** (slow operation, non-critical)
5. **Send Email** (with retry on failure)
6. **Update Billing Status** (final step)

**Chaos Features**:
- Configurable step failure rates (10% base rate)
- Different failure probabilities per step type
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Non-critical step handling (PDF generation can fail)

### 2. Complex Data Pipeline Workflow (`ComplexDataPipelineWorkflow`)

**Purpose**: Tests data processing scenarios with loops, conditional branching, and circuit breaker patterns.

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Fetch Data Sources** (variable count: 3-8 sources)
2. **Process Sources** (loop with error tolerance)
3. **Validate Results** (triggers cleanup if too many failures)
4. **Aggregate Results** (complex processing)
5. **Publish Results** (with circuit breaker pattern, 3 retry attempts)

**Chaos Features**:
- Variable source count for load testing
- 20% failure rate per source processing
- Failure tolerance (continues if >50% sources succeed)
- Circuit breaker pattern with exponential backoff

### 3. Complex State Machine Workflow (`ComplexStateMachineWorkflow`)

**Purpose**: Validates complex state transitions and decision points under failure conditions.

**State Machine**:
- **Initial States**: process, review, escalate
- **Transitions**: Based on probability and business logic
- **Terminal States**: approve, reject, terminate
- **Recovery**: Failed transitions default to "review" (safe state)
- **Limits**: Maximum 10 transitions to prevent infinite loops

**Chaos Features**:
- 15% transition failure rate
- State recovery mechanisms
- Complex business logic validation

## Chaos Testing Framework

### ChaosSimulator Components

**Failure Controls**:
- `databaseFailureRate`: Configurable database operation failure rate
- `workerCrashRate`: Worker crash simulation rate
- `networkPartitionRate`: Network partition simulation rate
- `slowQueryRate`: Database query slowdown rate

**Metrics Tracking**:
- Worker crashes, database failures, network partitions
- Workflow start/completion/failure counts
- Per-workflow-type detailed metrics

### Test Phases

#### Phase 1: Stable Conditions
- **Setup**: 5 workers processing mixed workflow types
- **Load**: 20 initial workflows (billing, pipeline, state machine)
- **Purpose**: Establish baseline performance
- **Duration**: 5 seconds

#### Phase 2: Moderate Chaos
- **Chaos Rates**:
  - Database failures: 5%
  - Worker crashes: 2%
  - Slow queries: 10%
- **Load**: 30 additional workflows
- **Purpose**: Test graceful degradation
- **Duration**: Progressive with random worker crashes

#### Phase 3: Extreme Chaos
- **Chaos Rates**:
  - Database failures: 20%
  - Worker crashes: 10%
  - Network partitions: 15%
  - Slow queries: 30%
- **Load**: 50 burst workflows (concurrent submission)
- **Actions**: Force crash 2 workers
- **Purpose**: Validate system limits and recovery

#### Phase 4: Recovery
- **Actions**: Disable all chaos, restore workers
- **Purpose**: Verify system self-healing
- **Duration**: 10 seconds stabilization

## Database Failure Testing

### FailureInjectingStore

**Implementation**: Wrapper around the real store that randomly injects failures based on configurable rates.

**Affected Operations**:
- `CreateWorkflow`: Workflow submission failures
- `GetPendingWorkflows`: Query failures
- `UpdateWorkflowStatus`: Status update failures
- `CreateStep`: Step creation failures
- `UpdateStepStatus`: Step completion failures

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Submission Failures
- **Setup**: 50% database failure rate
- **Test**: Submit 20 workflows
- **Expected**: Mix of successes and failures
- **Result**: ~50% failure rate with clear error messages

#### 2. Recovery Testing
- **Setup**: Restore database (0% failure rate)
- **Test**: Submit 10 workflows
- **Expected**: High completion rate
- **Result**: 80% completion rate achieved

#### 3. Processing Interruption
- **Setup**: Submit workflows, then introduce 30% failure rate during processing
- **Test**: Monitor workflow state changes
- **Expected**: Workflows recover after database restoration
- **Result**: Workflows resume and complete after recovery

## Validation Criteria

### Data Consistency Checks

1. **Step Execution Uniqueness**:
   ```go
   stepExecutions := make(map[string]int)
   for _, step := range steps {
       key := fmt.Sprintf("%s-%s", step.ExecutionID, step.StepName)
       stepExecutions[key]++
   }
   // Verify no step executes more than once
   ```

2. **Workflow State Integrity**:
   - All workflows in valid states
   - No orphaned running workflows
   - Proper state transitions

3. **Lease Consistency**:
   - No duplicate leases
   - Proper lease expiration
   - Worker crash recovery

### Success Criteria

✅ **Data Consistency**: Zero duplicate executions across all chaos scenarios
✅ **Graceful Degradation**: <50% workflow failure rate even under extreme chaos
✅ **Recovery**: System self-heals when failures stop
✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages, no system crashes
✅ **Resilience**: Workers continue operating despite database failures
