## Documentation Standards

### Every Page Should Include:
1. **Clear title and description**
2. **Working code example** within first 3 paragraphs
3. **Practical use cases**
4. **Cross-references** to related topics
5. **"Next steps"** section at the end

### Code Examples Should:
1. Be **complete and runnable**
2. Include **error handling**
3. Show **real-world scenarios**
4. Have **inline comments**
5. Follow **Go best practices**

### Writing Style:
- **Concise but complete**
- **Active voice**
- **Present tense**
- **Second person** ("you" not "the user")
- **Practical over theoretical**

## Success Metrics

- [ ] New user can go from zero to running workflow in < 5 minutes
- [ ] All core concepts have at least 3 code examples
- [ ] Every feature has a complete working example
- [ ] Production deployment guide tested on real infrastructure
- [ ] Community provides positive feedback on clarity and completeness

## Notes

- Start with Phase 1 and 2 as they're critical for adoption
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Examples should use consistent scenarios across docs
- Keep updating based on user feedback and questions
- Consider video tutorials for complex topics after Phase 3
