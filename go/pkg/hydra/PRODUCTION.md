# Production Readiness Checklist

This document outlines the comprehensive testing and implementation requirements needed before hydra is ready for mission-critical production workloads, including infrastructure automation and billing workflows.

## Core Requirements
- **SLA**: Pending workflows picked up within 5 seconds (given worker capacity)
- **Use Cases**: Infrastructure automation (time-sensitive) + billing workflows
- **Dependencies**: Database is hard dependency (no complex failover needed)
- **Scaling**: No autoscaling in library (external metrics-based scaling)
- **Idempotency**: Developer responsibility for external API calls

## Testing Categories
