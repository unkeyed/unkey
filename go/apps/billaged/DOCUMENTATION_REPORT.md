## Key Technical Findings

### Resource Scoring Algorithm
**Implementation**: `aggregator.go:282-305`

Billaged uses a sophisticated weighted scoring system:
```
resourceScore = (cpuSeconds × 1.0) + (memoryGB × 0.5) + (diskMB × 0.3)
```

### Real-time Aggregation
**Performance**: 10,000+ metrics/second processing capability
**Memory**: ~1MB per 1000 active VMs
**Architecture**: Thread-safe in-memory data structures with delta calculations

### Multi-tenant Security
**Authentication**: SPIFFE workload identity verification
**Isolation**: Customer-scoped data aggregation with tenant boundaries
**Authorization**: Service-to-service mTLS communication
