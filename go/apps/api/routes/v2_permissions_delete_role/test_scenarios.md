# Test Scenarios for v2_permissions_delete_role

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that deletes a role.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [x] Successfully delete a role with valid ID
- [x] Delete role not currently assigned to any keys or entities
- [x] Delete role with appropriate authorization
- [x] Verify appropriate success response is returned
- [x] Verify audit log is created for the deletion
- [x] Verify all associated resources are properly cleaned up

## Error Cases

- [x] Attempt to delete non-existent role ID
- [x] Attempt to delete role with invalid ID format
- [x] Attempt to delete role with empty ID
- [x] Attempt to delete role currently assigned to keys or entities (cascading deletion implemented)
- [ ] Attempt to delete already deleted role
- [x] Attempt to delete role with malformed request

## Security Tests

- [x] Attempt to delete role without authentication
- [x] Attempt to delete role with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to delete role with expired token
- [x] Attempt to delete role with insufficient permissions
- [x] Attempt to delete role from another workspace (should be forbidden)
- [x] Verify correct permissions allow role deletion:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [x] Test with specific permission for deleting roles
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [x] Verify role record is correctly deleted in database
- [x] Verify role-permission relationships are properly cleaned up
- [x] Verify role-key relationships are properly handled
- [ ] Verify delete timestamp is correctly set
- [x] Verify workspace ID is validated during deletion

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Delete role with multiple permissions
- [ ] Delete role that was just created
- [ ] Delete role with special characters in name
- [ ] Delete multiple roles in succession
- [ ] Delete system/default roles (if any exist)
- [ ] Delete role during high system load

## Concurrency Tests

- [ ] Attempt concurrent deletions of the same role
- [ ] Test race conditions between deletion and other operations
- [ ] Attempt to use role while deletion is in progress

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for role deletion
- [ ] Test system performance when multiple roles are deleted concurrently
- [ ] Verify performance impact on authorization checks after role deletion

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify role listing endpoint no longer returns deleted role
- [ ] Verify attempts to use deleted role fail appropriately
- [ ] Verify keys or entities that referenced the role are updated correctly
- [ ] Verify analytics record deletion event correctly
- [ ] Verify audit trail contains complete deletion information
- [ ] Verify associated authorization checks no longer include deleted role

## Rollback/Recovery Tests

- [ ] Verify behavior for deletion during system failure
- [ ] Test recover/undelete functionality (if implemented)
