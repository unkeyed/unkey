# Test Scenarios for v2_permissions_get_permission

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that retrieves permission details.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [x] Successfully retrieve an existing permission by ID
- [x] Retrieve permission with a description
- [x] Verify response structure matches specification
- [x] Verify all expected fields are returned (ID, name, description, etc.)
- [x] Verify workspace ID is correctly returned
- [x] Verify creation timestamp is correctly formatted

## Error Cases

- [x] Attempt to retrieve non-existent permission ID
- [x] Attempt to retrieve permission with invalid ID format
- [x] Attempt to retrieve permission with empty ID
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve deleted permission (if soft delete is used)
- [x] Attempt to retrieve permission with malformed request

## Security Tests

- [x] Attempt to retrieve permission without authentication
- [x] Attempt to retrieve permission with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve permission with expired token
- [x] Attempt to retrieve permission with insufficient permissions
- [x] Attempt to retrieve permission from another workspace (should be forbidden)
- [x] Verify correct permissions allow permission retrieval:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [x] Test with specific permission for retrieving permissions
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [x] Verify returned data matches database record
- [x] Verify timestamps are correctly formatted
- [ ] Verify relationships are correctly represented (if applicable)
- [x] Verify workspace ID matches the expected workspace

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Retrieve permission with very long name
- [ ] Retrieve permission with very long description
- [ ] Retrieve permission with special characters in name/description
- [ ] Retrieve permission with Unicode characters in fields
- [x] Retrieve recently created permission
- [ ] Retrieve permission that was recently updated

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for permission retrieval
- [ ] Test concurrent retrieval of same permission
- [ ] Test retrieval under system load
- [ ] Compare performance with cached vs non-cached responses (if caching is implemented)

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly created permission can be retrieved immediately
- [ ] Verify changes to permission are reflected in subsequent retrievals
- [ ] Verify consistency between list permissions and get permission endpoints
- [ ] Verify audit logging works correctly for permission retrieval
- [ ] Verify permission is correctly associated with roles that use it
