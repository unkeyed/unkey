# Test Scenarios for v2_permissions_get_role

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that retrieves role details.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [x] Successfully retrieve an existing role by ID
- [x] Retrieve role with a description
- [x] Retrieve role with associated permissions
- [x] Verify response structure matches specification
- [x] Verify all expected fields are returned (ID, name, description, permissions, etc.)
- [x] Verify workspace ID is correctly returned
- [x] Verify creation timestamp is correctly formatted
- [x] Verify permissions list is complete and accurate

## Error Cases

- [x] Attempt to retrieve non-existent role ID
- [x] Attempt to retrieve role with invalid ID format
- [x] Attempt to retrieve role with empty ID
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve deleted role (if soft delete is used)
- [x] Attempt to retrieve role with malformed request

## Security Tests

- [x] Attempt to retrieve role without authentication
- [x] Attempt to retrieve role with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve role with expired token
- [x] Attempt to retrieve role with insufficient permissions
- [x] Attempt to retrieve role from another workspace (should be forbidden)
- [x] Verify correct permissions allow role retrieval:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [x] Test with specific permission for retrieving roles
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [x] Verify returned data matches database record
- [x] Verify permissions associated with the role are correctly returned
- [x] Verify timestamps are correctly formatted
- [x] Verify relationships are correctly represented
- [x] Verify workspace ID matches the expected workspace

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Retrieve role with very long name
- [ ] Retrieve role with very long description
- [ ] Retrieve role with a large number of permissions
- [ ] Retrieve role with special characters in name/description
- [ ] Retrieve role with Unicode characters in fields
- [x] Retrieve recently created role
- [ ] Retrieve role that was recently updated
- [x] Retrieve role with no associated permissions

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for role retrieval
- [ ] Test concurrent retrieval of same role
- [ ] Test retrieval under system load
- [ ] Compare performance with cached vs non-cached responses (if caching is implemented)
- [ ] Test performance with roles that have many permissions

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly created role can be retrieved immediately
- [ ] Verify changes to role are reflected in subsequent retrievals
- [ ] Verify consistency between list roles and get role endpoints
- [ ] Verify audit logging works correctly for role retrieval
- [ ] Verify role's permission list matches individually retrieved permissions
- [ ] Verify any entities assigned this role reflect the correct permissions
