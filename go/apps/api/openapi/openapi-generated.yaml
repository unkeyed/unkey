                Unkey uses API keys (root keys) for authentication. These keys authorize access to management operations in the API.
                To authenticate, include your root key in the Authorization header of each request:
                ```
                Authorization: Bearer unkey_123
                ```
                Root keys have specific permissions attached to them, controlling what operations they can perform. Key permissions follow a hierarchical structure with patterns like `resource.resource_id.action` (e.g., `apis.*.create_key`, `apis.*.read_api`).
                Security best practices:
                - Keep root keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
                - Use different root keys for different environments
                - Rotate keys periodically, especially after team member departures
                - Create keys with minimal necessary permissions following least privilege principle
                - Monitor key usage with audit logs.

                        Adds a visual identifier to the beginning of the generated key for easier recognition in logs and dashboards.
                        The prefix becomes part of the actual key string (e.g., `prod_xxxxxxxxx`).
                        Avoid using sensitive information in prefixes as they may appear in logs and error messages.
                    example: prod

                        Consider 32 bytes for highly sensitive APIs, but avoid values above 64 bytes unless specifically required.

                        During verification, all permissions from assigned roles are checked against requested permissions.
                        Roles provide a convenient way to group permissions and apply consistent access patterns across multiple keys.

                        The credit value to use with the specified operation. The meaning depends on the operation: for 'set', this becomes the new remaining credits value; for 'increment', this amount is added to current credits; for 'decrement', this amount is subtracted from current credits.

                        Set to null when using 'set' operation to make the key unlimited (removes usage restrictions entirely). When decrementing, if the result would be negative, remaining credits are automatically set to zero. Credits are consumed during successful key verification, and when credits reach zero, verification fails with `code=INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`.

                        Required when using 'increment' or 'decrement' operations. Optional for 'set' operation (null creates unlimited usage).

                        Avoid setting timestamps in the past as they immediately invalidate the key.
                        Keys expire based on server time, not client time, which prevents timezone-related issues.
                        Active sessions continue until their next verification attempt after expiry.

                            During verification, all permissions from assigned roles are checked against requested permissions.
                            Roles provide a convenient way to group permissions and apply consistent access patterns across multiple keys.
                    example:

                - Remove outdated tiering or custom limit rules
                - Fix misconfigured overrides

                Once deleted, the override cannot be recovered, and the operation takes effect immediately.

                        When this limit is reached, subsequent requests fail with `RATE_LIMITED` until the window resets.
                        Balance user experience with resource protection when setting limits for different user tiers.
                        Consider system capacity, business requirements, and fair usage policies in limit determination.

                Sets a new or overwrites an existing rate limit override. Overrides allow you to apply special rate limit rules to specific identifiers, providing custom limits that differ from the default.

                Overrides are useful for:
                - Granting higher limits to premium users or trusted partners
                - Implementing stricter limits for suspicious or abusive users
                - Creating tiered access levels with different quotas
                - Implementing temporary rate limit adjustments
                - Prioritizing important clients with higher limits

                        The duration in milliseconds for the rate limit window. This defines how long the rate limit counter accumulates before resetting to zero.

                        Considerations:
                        - This can differ from the default duration for the namespace
                        - Longer durations create stricter limits that take longer to reset
                        - Shorter durations allow more frequent bursts of activity

                        - An IP address for location-based rules
                        - An email domain for organization-wide policies
                        - Any other string that identifies the target entity

                        Wildcards (*) can be used to create pattern-matching rules that apply to multiple identifiers. For example:
                        - 'premium_*' would match all identifiers starting with 'premium_'
                        - '*_admin' would match all identifiers ending with '_admin'
                        - '*suspicious*' would match any identifier containing 'suspicious'

                        The name of this rate limit. This name is used to identify which limit to check during key verification.

                        Best practices for limit names:
                        - Use descriptive, semantic names like 'api_requests', 'heavy_operations', or 'downloads'
                        - Be consistent with naming conventions across your application
                        - Create separate limits for different resource types or operation costs
                        - Consider using namespaced names for better organization (e.g., 'files.downloads', 'compute.training')

                        You will reference this exact name when verifying keys to check against this specific limit.
                    type: string
                    example: api
                    minLength: 3
                    maxLength: 128
                limit:
                    description: |-
                        The maximum number of operations allowed within the specified time window.

                        When this limit is reached, verification requests will fail with `code=RATE_LIMITED` until the window resets. The limit should reflect:
                        - Your infrastructure capacity and scaling limitations
                        - Fair usage expectations for your service
                        - Different tier levels for various user types
                        - The relative cost of the operations being limited

                        Higher values allow more frequent access but may impact service performance.

                duration:
                    description: |-
                        The duration for each ratelimit window in milliseconds.

                        This controls how long the rate limit counter accumulates before resetting. Common values include:
                        - 1000 (1 second): For strict per-second limits on high-frequency operations
                        - 60000 (1 minute): For moderate API usage control
                        - 3600000 (1 hour): For less frequent but costly operations
                        - 86400000 (24 hours): For daily quotas

                        Shorter windows provide more frequent resets but may allow large burst usage. Longer windows provide more consistent usage patterns but take longer to reset after limit exhaustion.

                        - Prefix is extracted from the original key or uses API default

                        - A pattern with wildcards for matching multiple entities

                        Wildcard examples:
                        - 'admin_*' matches any identifier starting with 'admin_'
                        - '*_test' matches any identifier ending with '_test'
                        - '*premium*' matches any identifier containing 'premium'

                        More complex patterns can combine multiple wildcards. Detailed documentation on pattern matching rules is available at https://www.unkey.com/docs/ratelimiting/overrides#wildcard-rules

        Unkey's API provides programmatic access for all resources within our platform.


        ### Authentication
        #
        This API uses HTTP Bearer authentication with root keys. Most endpoints require specific permissions associated with your root key. When making requests, include your root key in the `Authorization` header:
        ```
        Authorization: Bearer unkey_xxxxxxxxxxx
        ```

        All responses follow a consistent envelope structure that separates operational metadata from actual data. This design provides several benefits:
        - Debugging: Every response includes a unique requestId for tracing issues
        - Consistency: Predictable response format across all endpoints
        - Extensibility: Easy to add new metadata without breaking existing integrations
        - Error Handling: Unified error format with actionable information

        ### Success Response Format:
        ```json
        {
          "meta": {
            "requestId": "req_123456"
          },
          "data": {
            // Actual response data here
          }
        }
        ```

        The meta object contains operational information:
        - `requestId`: Unique identifier for this request (essential for support)

        The data object contains the actual response data specific to each endpoint.

        ### Paginated Response Format:
        ```json
        {
          "meta": {
            "requestId": "req_123456"
          },
          "data": [
            // Array of results
          ],
          "pagination": {
            "cursor": "next_page_token",
            "hasMore": true
          }
        }
        ```

        The pagination object appears on list endpoints and contains:
        - `cursor`: Token for requesting the next page
        - `hasMore`: Whether more results are available

        ### Error Response Format:
        ```json
        {
          "meta": {
            "requestId": "req_2c9a0jf23l4k567"
          },
          "error": {
            "detail": "The resource you are attempting to modify is protected and cannot be changed",
            "status": 403,
            "title": "Forbidden",
            "type": "https://unkey.com/docs/errors/unkey/application/protected_resource"
          }
        }
        ```

        Error responses include comprehensive diagnostic information:
        - `title`: Human-readable error summary
        - `detail`: Specific description of what went wrong
        - `status`: HTTP status code
        - `type`: Link to error documentation
        - `errors`: Array of validation errors (for 400 responses)

        This structure ensures you always have the context needed to debug issues and take corrective action.

                Your root key must have one of the following permissions for basic key listing:
                - `api.*.read_key` (to read keys from any API)
                - `api.<api_id>.read_key` (to read keys from a specific API)

                Additionally, you need read access to the API itself:
                - `api.*.read_api` or `api.<api_id>.read_api`

                Additional permission required for decrypt functionality:
                - `api.*.decrypt_key` or `api.<api_id>.decrypt_key`

                Create an identity to group multiple API keys under a single entity. Identities enable shared rate limits and metadata across all associated keys.

                Perfect for users with multiple devices, organizations with multiple API keys, or when you need unified rate limiting across different services.

                **Important**

                Create a new API key for user authentication and authorization.

                - Generate keys for new user registrations
                - Create additional keys for different applications

                Retrieve detailed key information for dashboard interfaces and administrative purposes.

                Use this to build key management dashboards showing users their key details, status, permissions, and usage data. You can identify keys by `keyId` or the actual key string.

                **Important**: Set `decrypt: true` only in secure contexts to retrieve plaintext key values from recoverable keys.

                **Required Permissions**

                Your root key must have one of the following permissions for basic key information:
                - `api.*.read_key` (to read keys from any API)
                - `api.<api_id>.read_key` (to read keys from a specific API)

                Additional permission required for decrypt functionality:
                - `api.*.decrypt_key` or `api.<api_id>.decrypt_key`

                Use this for privilege downgrades, removing temporary access, or plan changes that revoke specific capabilities. Permissions granted through roles remain unchanged.

                **Important**: Changes take effect immediately with up to 30-second edge propagation.

                **Required Permissions**

                Generate a new API key while preserving the configuration from an existing key.

                This operation creates a fresh key with a new token while maintaining all settings from the original key:
                - Permissions and roles
                - Custom metadata
                - Rate limit configurations
                - Identity associations
                - Remaining credits
                - Recovery settings

                **Key Generation:**
                - The system attempts to extract the prefix from the original key
                - If prefix extraction fails, the default API prefix is used
                - Key length follows the API's default byte configuration (or 16 bytes if not specified)

                **Original Key Handling:**
                - The original key will be revoked after the duration specified in `expiration`
                - Set `expiration` to 0 to revoke immediately
                - This allows for graceful key rotation with an overlap period

                Common use cases include:
                - Rotating keys for security compliance
                - Issuing replacement keys for compromised credentials
                - Creating backup keys with identical permissions

                **Important:** Analytics and usage metrics are tracked at both the key level AND identity level. If the original key has an identity, the new key will inherit it, allowing you to track usage across both individual keys and the overall identity.

                **Required Permissions**

                 Your root key must have:
                 - `api.*.create_key` or `api.<api_id>.create_key`
                 - `api.*.encrypt_key` or `api.<api_id>.encrypt_key` (only when the original key is recoverable)

                Replace all permissions on a key with the specified set in a single atomic operation.

                Use this to synchronize with external systems, reset permissions to a known state, or apply standardized permission templates. Permissions granted through roles remain unchanged.

                **Important**: Changes take effect immediately with up to 30-second edge propagation.

                **Required Permissions**

                Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
                - `api.*.update_key` (to update keys in any API)
                - `api.<api_id>.update_key` (to update keys in a specific API)

                **Side Effects**

                Invalidates the key cache for immediate effect, and makes permission changes available for verification within 30 seconds across all regions.

                Update credit quotas in response to plan changes, billing cycles, or usage purchases.

                Use this for user upgrades/downgrades, monthly quota resets, credit purchases, or promotional bonuses. Supports three operations: set, increment, or decrement credits. Set to null for unlimited usage.

                **Important**: Setting unlimited credits automatically clears existing refill configurations.

                **Required Permissions**

                Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
                - `api.*.update_key` (to update keys in any API)

                Credit updates remove the key from cache immediately. Setting credits to unlimited automatically clears any existing refill settings. Changes take effect instantly but may take up to 30 seconds to propagate to all edge regions.

                Update key properties in response to plan changes, subscription updates, or account status changes.

                Use this for user upgrades/downgrades, role modifications, or administrative changes. Supports partial updates - only specify fields you want to change. Set fields to null to clear them.

                **Important**: Permissions and roles are replaced entirely. Use dedicated add/remove endpoints for incremental changes.

                **Required Permissions**

                Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
                - `api.*.update_key` (to update keys in any API)
                - `api.<api_id>.update_key` (to update keys in a specific API)

                **Side Effects**

                If you specify an `externalId` that doesn't exist, a new identity will be automatically created and linked to the key. Permission updates will auto-create any permissions that don't exist in your workspace. Changes take effect immediately but may take up to 30 seconds to propagate to all edge regions due to cache invalidation.

                Verify an API key's validity and permissions for request authentication.

                Use this endpoint on every incoming request to your protected resources. It checks key validity, permissions, rate limits, and usage quotas in a single call.

                **Important**: Always returns HTTP 200. Check the `valid` field in response data to determine if the key is authorized.

                **Common use cases:**
                - Authenticate API requests before processing
                - Enforce permission-based access control
                - Track usage and apply rate limits

                **Required Permissions**

                Your root key needs one of:
                - `api.*.verify_key` (verify keys in any API)
                - `api.<api_id>.verify_key` (verify keys in specific API)

                If you are getting a NOT_FOUND error, ensure your root key has the required verify key permissions.

                        Key verification process completed. This endpoint always returns HTTP 200 regardless of whether the key passed or failed verification. You must check the `valid` field in the response data to determine the actual verification result.

                        When verification succeeds, the response includes comprehensive information about the key including its current status, remaining credits, expiration time, associated permissions and roles, metadata, and any rate limiting information. This data enables your application to make informed authorization decisions and provide appropriate user experiences.

                        When verification fails, the response indicates the specific reason through the `code` field while setting `valid` to false. The failure codes help you handle different scenarios appropriately, such as directing users to renew expired keys, upgrade for more credits, or contact support for disabled keys.

                        The response also includes identity information when the key is associated with an identity, providing additional context about the key holder and any identity-specific rate limits or metadata that may apply to the verification.

                Find out what key this is.

                **Required Permissions**

                Your root key must have one of the following permissions for basic key information:
                - `api.*.read_key` (to read keys from any API)
                - `api.<api_id>.read_key` (to read keys from a specific API)

                If your rootkey lacks permissions but the key exists, we may return a 404 status here to prevent leaking the existance of a key to unauthorized clients. If you believe that a key should exist, but receive a 404, please double check your root key has the correct permissions.

                Check and enforce rate limits for any identifier (user ID, IP address, API client, etc.).

                Use this for rate limiting beyond API keys - limit users by ID, IPs by address, or any custom identifier. Supports namespace organization, variable costs, and custom overrides.

                **Response Codes**: Rate limit checks return HTTP 200 regardless of whether the limit is exceeded - check the `success` field in the response to determine if the request should be allowed. 4xx responses indicate auth, namespace existence/deletion, or validation errors (e.g., 410 Gone for deleted namespaces). 5xx responses indicate server errors.

                **Required Permissions**

                Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
                - `ratelimit.*.limit` (to check limits in any namespace)
                - `ratelimit.<namespace_id>.limit` (to check limits in a specific namespace)

                Check and enforce multiple rate limits in a single request for any identifiers (user IDs, IP addresses, API clients, etc.).

                Use this to efficiently check multiple rate limits at once. Each rate limit check is independent and returns its own result with a top-level `passed` indicator showing if all checks succeeded.

                **Response Codes**: Rate limit checks return HTTP 200 regardless of whether limits are exceeded - check the `passed` field to see if all limits passed, or the `success` field in each individual result. 4xx responses indicate auth, namespace existence/deletion, or validation errors (e.g., 410 Gone for deleted namespaces). 5xx responses indicate server errors.

                **Required Permissions**

                Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
                - `ratelimit.*.limit` (to check limits in any namespace)
                - `ratelimit.<namespace_id>.limit` (to check limits in all specific namespaces being checked)

                Create or update a custom rate limit for specific identifiers, bypassing the namespace default.

                Use this to create premium tiers with higher limits, apply stricter limits to specific users, or implement emergency throttling.

                **Important:** Overrides take effect immediately and completely replace the default limit for matching identifiers. Use wildcard patterns (e.g., `premium_*`) to match multiple identifiers.

                **Permissions:** Requires `ratelimit.*.set_override` or `ratelimit.<namespace_id>.set_override`
