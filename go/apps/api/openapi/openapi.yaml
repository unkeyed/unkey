  title: Unkey API
  version: 2.0.0
  description: |-
    Unkey's API provides programmatic access for all resources within our platform.



    ### Authentication
    #
    This API uses HTTP Bearer authentication with root keys. Most endpoints require specific permissions associated with your root key. When making requests, include your root key in the `Authorization` header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer unkey_xxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

    All responses follow a consistent envelope structure that separates operational metadata from actual data. This design provides several benefits:
    - Debugging: Every response includes a unique requestId for tracing issues
    - Consistency: Predictable response format across all endpoints
    - Extensibility: Easy to add new metadata without breaking existing integrations
    - Error Handling: Unified error format with actionable information

    ### Success Response Format:
    ```json
    {
      "meta": {
        "requestId": "req_123456"
      },
      "data": {
        // Actual response data here
      }
    }
    ```

    The meta object contains operational information:
    - `requestId`: Unique identifier for this request (essential for support)

    The data object contains the actual response data specific to each endpoint.

    ### Paginated Response Format:
    ```json
    {
      "meta": {
        "requestId": "req_123456"
      },
      "data": [
        // Array of results
      ],
      "pagination": {
        "cursor": "next_page_token",
        "hasMore": true
      }
    }
    ```

    The pagination object appears on list endpoints and contains:
    - `cursor`: Token for requesting the next page
    - `hasMore`: Whether more results are available

    ### Error Response Format:
    ```json
    {
      "meta": {
        "requestId": "req_2c9a0jf23l4k567"
      },
      "error": {
        "detail": "The resource you are attempting to modify is protected and cannot be changed",
        "status": 403,
        "title": "Forbidden",
        "type": "https://unkey.com/docs/api-reference/errors-v2/unkey/application/protected_resource"
      }
    }
    ```

    Error responses include comprehensive diagnostic information:
    - `title`: Human-readable error summary
    - `detail`: Specific description of what went wrong
    - `status`: HTTP status code
    - `type`: Link to error documentation
    - `errors`: Array of validation errors (for 400 responses)

    This structure ensures you always have the context needed to debug issues and take corrective action.

      description: |-
        Unkey uses API keys (root keys) for authentication. These keys authorize access to management operations in the API.

        To authenticate, include your root key in the Authorization header of each request:
        ```
        Authorization: Bearer unkey_123
        ```

        Root keys have specific permissions attached to them, controlling what operations they can perform. Key permissions follow a hierarchical structure with patterns like `resource.resource_id.action` (e.g., `apis.*.create_key`, `apis.*.read_api`).

        Security best practices:
        - Keep root keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
        - Use different root keys for different environments
        - Rotate keys periodically, especially after team member departures
        - Create keys with minimal necessary permissions following least privilege principle
        - Monitor key usage with audit logs.

            Specifies which key to update using the database identifier returned from `createKey`.
            Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.
          example: key_2cGKbMxRyIzhCxo1Idjz8q
        name:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          minLength: 1
          maxLength: 200 # Human-readable names should be concise but descriptive
          description: |
            Sets a human-readable name for internal organization and identification.
            Omitting this field leaves the current name unchanged, while setting null removes it entirely.
            Avoid generic names like "API Key" when managing multiple keys per user or service.
          example: Payment Service Production Key
        externalId:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          minLength: 1
          maxLength: 255 # Match database varchar limits for external identifiers
          pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$"
          description: |
            Links this key to a user or entity in your system for ownership tracking during verification.
            Omitting this field preserves the current association, while setting null disconnects the key from any identity.
            Essential for user-specific analytics, billing, and key management across multiple users.
            Supports letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens for flexible identifier formats.
          example: user_912a841d
        meta:
          type: object
          nullable: true
          additionalProperties: true
          maxProperties: 100 # Prevent DoS while allowing rich metadata
          description: |
            Stores arbitrary JSON metadata returned during key verification.
            Omitting this field preserves existing metadata, while setting null removes all metadata entirely.
            Avoid storing sensitive data here as it's returned in verification responses.
            Large metadata objects increase verification latency and should stay under 10KB total size.
          example:
            plan: enterprise
            limits:
              storage: 500GB
              compute: 1000 minutes/month

              notifications: true
            lastBillingDate: "2023-10-15"
        expires:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          format: int64
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 4102444800000 # January 1, 2100 - reasonable future limit
          description: |
            Sets when this key automatically expires as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.
            Verification fails with code=EXPIRED immediately after this time passes.
            Omitting this field preserves the current expiration, while setting null makes the key permanent.

            Avoid setting timestamps in the past as they immediately invalidate the key.
            Keys expire based on server time, not client time, which prevents timezone-related issues.
            Active sessions continue until their next verification attempt after expiry.

          "$ref": "#/components/schemas/KeyCreditsResponse"
          description: |
            Controls usage-based limits for this key through credit consumption.
            Omitting this field preserves current credit settings, while setting null enables unlimited usage.
            Cannot configure refill settings when credits is null, and refillDay requires monthly interval.
            Essential for implementing usage-based pricing and subscription quotas.
        ratelimits:
          type: array
          nullable: true
          maxItems: 50 # Reasonable limit for rate limit configurations per key

          description: |
            Defines time-based rate limits that protect against abuse by controlling request frequency.
            Omitting this field preserves existing rate limits, while setting null removes all rate limits.
            Unlike credits which track total usage, rate limits reset automatically after each window expires.
            Multiple rate limits can control different operation types with separate thresholds and windows.
        enabled:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Controls whether the key is currently active for verification requests.
            When set to `false`, all verification attempts fail with `code=DISABLED` regardless of other settings.
            Omitting this field preserves the current enabled status.
            Useful for temporarily suspending access during billing issues, security incidents, or maintenance windows without losing key configuration.

        Empty response object by design. A successful response indicates
        the key was updated successfully. The endpoint doesn't return the updated
        key to reduce response size and avoid exposing sensitive information. Changes
        may take up to 30 seconds to propagate to all regions due to cache invalidation
        delays. If you need the updated key state, use a subsequent call to `keys.getKey`.

            Specifies which key to delete using the database identifier returned from `createKey`.
            Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.
            Deletion immediately invalidates the key, causing all future verification attempts to fail with `code=NOT_FOUND`.
            Key deletion triggers cache invalidation across all regions but may take up to 30 seconds to fully propagate.
          example: key_2cGKbMxRyIzhCxo1Idjz8q
        permanent:
          type: boolean
          default: false
          description: |
            Controls deletion behavior between recoverable soft-deletion and irreversible permanent erasure.
            Soft deletion (default) preserves key data for potential recovery through direct database operations.
            Permanent deletion completely removes all traces including hash values and metadata with no recovery option.

            Use permanent deletion only for regulatory compliance (GDPR), resolving hash collisions, or when reusing identical key strings.
            Permanent deletion cannot be undone and may affect analytics data that references the deleted key.
            Most applications should use soft deletion to maintain audit trails and prevent accidental data loss.
          example: false
      additionalProperties: false
    KeysDeleteKeyResponseData:
      type: object
      properties: {}
      description: |
        Confirms successful key deletion with no additional data returned.
        Deletion immediately invalidates the key in the primary database but cache propagation across regions may take up to 30 seconds.
        During this propagation window, some verification attempts might still succeed in certain regions due to eventual consistency.
        Monitor your application logs during the propagation period to ensure no unexpected authentication successes occur.

            Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.
            Key data includes metadata, permissions, usage statistics, and configuration but never the plaintext key value unless `decrypt=true`.
            Find this ID in creation responses, key listings, dashboard, or verification responses.

            Controls whether to include the plaintext key value in the response for recovery purposes.
            Only works for keys created with `recoverable=true` and requires the `decrypt_key` permission.
            Returned keys must be handled securely, never logged, cached, or stored insecurely.

            Use only for legitimate recovery scenarios like user password resets or emergency access.
            Most applications should keep this false to maintain security best practices and avoid accidental key exposure.
            Decryption requests are audited and may trigger security alerts in enterprise environments.

            Added permissions supplement existing permissions and roles without replacing them.
            Permission changes take effect immediately but may take up to 30 seconds to propagate across all regions.

            Permission changes take effect immediately but cache propagation across regions may take up to 30 seconds.

                  Takes precedence over slug when both are provided in the same object.
                  The referenced permission must already exist in your workspace.

                description: |
                  Identifies the permission by its human-readable name using hierarchical naming patterns.
                  Use `resource.action` format for logical organization and verification flexibility.
                  Slugs must be unique within your `workspace` and support wildcard matching during verification.
                  Combined with `create=true`, allows automatic permission creation for streamlined workflows.
                example: documents.write
              create:
                type: boolean

                  Enables automatic permission creation when the specified slug does not exist.
                  Only works with slug-based references, not ID-based references.
                  Requires the `rbac.*.create_permission` permission on your root key.

                  Created permissions are permanent and visible workspace-wide to all API keys.
                  Use carefully to avoid permission proliferation from typos or uncontrolled creation.
                  Consider centralizing permission creation in controlled processes for better governance.
                  Auto-created permissions use the slug as both the name and identifier.

              This ID can be used in other API calls to reference this specific permission.
              IDs are guaranteed unique and won't change, making them ideal for scripting
              and automation. You can store these IDs in your system for consistent
              reference.

              IDs are guaranteed unique and won't change, making them ideal for scripting
              and automation. You can store these IDs in your system for consistent
              reference.

              The slug of the permission, typically following a `resource.action` pattern like `documents.read`. Names are human-readable identifiers used both for assignment and verification.

              During verification:
              - The exact name is matched (e.g., `documents.read`)
              - Hierarchical wildcards are supported in verification requests
              - A key with permission `documents.*` grants access to `documents.read`, `documents.write`, etc.
              - Wildcards can appear at any level: `billing.*.view` matches `billing.invoices.view` and `billing.payments.view`

              However, when adding permissions, you must specify each exact permission - wildcards are not valid for assignment.

            The permissions to set for this key. This is a complete replacement operation - it overwrites all existing direct permissions with this new set.

            Key behaviors:
            - Providing an empty array removes all direct permissions from the key
            - This only affects direct permissions - permissions granted through roles are not affected
            - All existing direct permissions not included in this list will be removed
            - The complete list approach allows synchronizing permissions with external systems
            - Permission changes take effect immediately for new verifications

            Unlike addPermissions (which only adds) or removePermissions (which only removes), this endpoint performs a wholesale replacement of the permission set.

                  Provide either ID or slug for each permission, not both. Using ID
                  is more precise and guarantees you're referencing the exact permission
                  intended, regardless of slug changes or duplicates. IDs are particularly
                  useful in automation scripts and when migrating permissions between
                  environments.

                  in your permission system - including case sensitivity and the complete
                  hierarchical path. Slugs are generally more human-readable but can
                  be ambiguous if not carefully managed across your workspace.
                example: documents.write
                minLength: 1
              create:

                  When true, if a permission with this slug doesn't exist, it will be automatically created on-the-fly. Only works when specifying slug, not ID.

                  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
                  - Requires the `rbac.*.create_permission` permission on your root key
                  - Created permissions are permanent and visible throughout your workspace
                  - Use carefully to avoid permission proliferation and inconsistency
                  - Consider using a controlled process for permission creation instead
                  - Typos with `create=true` will create unintended permissions that persist in your system

        (like an identity with a duplicate externalId) or when performing an operation
        that conflicts with the resource's current state. When receiving this error,
        the request should be modified to resolve the conflict before retrying, or

        Error response when authentication has failed or credentials are missing. This occurs when:

        - The Authorization header is missing
        - The root key is invalid or has been revoked
        - The root key format is incorrect
        - The authentication token has expired

        To fix this error:
        1. Ensure you're including the `Authorization` header with format: `Bearer your_root_key`
        2. Verify your root key is valid and has not been revoked in the Unkey dashboard
        3. Check that you're using the correct root key for the environment
        4. If using a new key, ensure it was created successfully

        For security reasons, the specific reason for authentication failure may be intentionally vague in the error message. Check your Unkey dashboard for more detailed information about your root keys.

        Error response when the caller is authenticated but lacks permission to perform the requested operation. This occurs when:

        - The root key doesn't have the required permissions for the operation
        - The caller is trying to access resources from a different workspace
        - The caller is attempting to access another user's resources
        - The operation violates a policy restriction

        Unlike Unauthorized (401) which indicates authentication issues, Forbidden (403) indicates authorization problems for an authenticated caller.

        To fix this error:
        1. Check the permissions assigned to your root key in the Unkey dashboard
        2. Verify you're operating within the correct workspace
        3. Ensure you have the necessary scope to access the requested resource
        4. Request additional permissions if needed from your workspace administrator

        Permission patterns in Unkey follow a hierarchical structure:
        - 'resource.*' grants all permissions for a resource
        - 'resource.read' grants read-only access
        - 'resource.write' grants write access

        Common permission requirements for endpoints include:
        - keys.create - For creating new API keys
        - keys.read - For retrieving key information
        - keys.update - For modifying existing keys
        - keys.delete - For removing keys
        - apis.* - For managing API namespaces

            Identifies the rate limit category using hierarchical naming for organization and monitoring.
            Namespaces must start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, underscores, dots, slashes, or hyphens.
            Use descriptive, hierarchical names like 'auth.login', 'api.requests', or 'media.uploads' for clear categorization.
            Namespaces must be unique within your workspace and support segmentation of different API operations.
            Consistent naming conventions across your application improve monitoring and debugging capabilities.

        - Reset entities back to standard rate limits
        - Clean up temporary overrides
        - Remove outdated tiering or custom limit rules
        - Fix misconfigured overrides

            Essential for implementing fair usage policies and tiered access levels in multi-tenant applications.

            Rate limit counters are shared across all keys with this identity, regardless of how many keys the user creates.
            During verification, specify which named limits to check for enforcement.
            Identity rate limits supplement any key-specific rate limits that may also be configured.
            - Each named limit can have different thresholds and windows

            When verifying keys, you can specify which limits you want to use and all keys attached to this identity will share the limits, regardless of which specific key is used.

            The name of this rate limit. This name is used to identify which limit to check during key verification.

            Best practices for limit names:
            - Use descriptive, semantic names like 'api_requests', 'heavy_operations', or 'downloads'
            - Be consistent with naming conventions across your application
            - Create separate limits for different resource types or operation costs
            - Consider using namespaced names for better organization (e.g., 'files.downloads', 'compute.training')

            You will reference this exact name when verifying keys to check against this specific limit.

            The maximum number of operations allowed within the specified time window.

            When this limit is reached, verification requests will fail with `code=RATE_LIMITED` until the window resets. The limit should reflect:
            - Your infrastructure capacity and scaling limitations
            - Fair usage expectations for your service
            - Different tier levels for various user types
            - The relative cost of the operations being limited

            Higher values allow more frequent access but may impact service performance.

            This controls how long the rate limit counter accumulates before resetting. Common values include:
            - 1000 (1 second): For strict per-second limits on high-frequency operations
            - 60000 (1 minute): For moderate API usage control
            - 3600000 (1 hour): For less frequent but costly operations
            - 86400000 (24 hours): For daily quotas

            Shorter windows provide more frequent resets but may allow large burst usage. Longer windows provide more consistent usage patterns but take longer to reset after limit exhaustion.

            APIs serve as containers for groups of keys and provide namespace separation between environments or services.
            Names must be unique within your workspace and are not shown to end users.

            Use descriptive names that clearly identify the API's purpose and environment:
            - Include environment indicators like 'production', 'staging', 'development'
            - Use service-based naming like 'payment-service', 'user-management', 'analytics'
            - Follow consistent naming conventions across your organization
            - Keep names concise but informative for easy identification

            Must start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens.
            Avoid generic names like 'api' or 'main' that don't provide meaningful context.

            Use this when you have stored the Unkey identity ID from previous API calls.
            Essential for direct identity management when you track Unkey's internal identifiers.

            Use this when you track identities by your own user IDs, organization IDs, or tenant identifiers.
            More convenient than identityId when integrating with existing user management systems.
            Accepts letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens for flexible identifier formats.

            Replaces all existing metadata with this new metadata object.
            Omitting this field preserves existing metadata, while providing an empty object clears all metadata.
            Avoid storing sensitive data here as it's returned in verification responses.
            Large metadata objects increase verification latency and should stay under 10KB total size.

      summary: Set (replace) all permissions on an API key
      description: |-
        Sets the permissions for an existing API key by replacing all existing direct permissions with the provided set. This is a complete replacement operation - permissions not specified in the request will be removed.

        Use this endpoint when you want to:
        - Synchronize API key permissions with an external system
        - Reset a key's permissions to a known state
        - Apply a standardized permission template to a key
        - Remove all permissions from a key (by providing an empty array)
        - Fix over-permissioned keys by applying the precise set needed

        Key differences from other endpoints:
        - Unlike addPermissions, this replaces all permissions instead of just adding
        - Unlike removePermissions, this sets the complete state rather than removing specific permissions
        - The advantage is atomic replacement in a single operation versus multiple incremental changes

        Only direct permissions are affected - permissions granted through roles remain unchanged. Changes take effect immediately for new verifications, though existing authorized sessions may continue until their cache expires (typically under 30 seconds).

      summary: Remove permissions from an API key
      description: |-
        Removes one or more permissions from an existing API key. This endpoint is used to selectively revoke access rights from a key without deleting it or affecting other permissions.

        Key features:
        - Selective removal - revoke specific permissions while leaving others intact
        - Direct permissions only - doesn't affect permissions granted through roles
        - Idempotent operation - removing permissions multiple times has no additional effect
        - Atomic transaction - all permissions are removed or none are (rollback on failure)
        - Immediate effect - new verifications will see changes within seconds
        - Cache invalidation - all regions eventually reflect the changes

        Use cases:
        - Downgrading user access privileges
        - Removing temporary elevated permissions
        - Implementing granular permission adjustments
        - Revoking access to specific resources

        This endpoint complements addPermissions (for granting) and setPermissions (for complete replacement). Use this when you need to selectively remove capabilities without altering other permissions.

      summary: Add roles to an API key
      description: |-
        Assigns one or more roles to an existing API key, incrementally adding to any existing roles already assigned. Roles are collections of permissions that provide a convenient way to assign multiple permissions at once rather than assigning individual permissions one by one.

        This operation is idempotent, meaning adding the same role multiple times has no additional effect. The assignment happens as an atomic transaction where all roles are added or none are with rollback on failure. Changes take effect immediately for new verifications within seconds, and during verification, permissions from all assigned roles are combined.

        Use this endpoint when promoting users to higher access levels, adding specialized function access to existing keys, or implementing role-based access control patterns. It provides a standardized way to bundle permissions across many keys while preserving existing role assignments. Unlike setRoles which replaces all roles, this endpoint only adds to the existing set of roles assigned to a key.

      summary: Add permissions to an API key
      description: |-
        Assigns one or more permissions to an existing API key. This endpoint is used to incrementally add permissions without removing existing ones.

        Permissions define access control capabilities that are validated during key verification. Each permission typically follows a 'resource.action' naming pattern (e.g., 'documents.read', 'users.create'). A key can have both direct permissions (added via this endpoint) and indirect permissions (granted through roles).

        Key features:
        - Idempotent operation - adding the same permission multiple times has no additional effect
        - Atomic transaction - all permissions are added or none are (rollback on failure)
        - Permission creation - optionally create new permissions if they don't exist (with 'create: true')
        - Cache invalidation - changes take effect immediately for new verifications
        - Hierarchical permissions - during verification, 'documents.*' grants access to both 'documents.read' and 'documents.write'

        Unlike setPermissions (which replaces all permissions), this endpoint only adds to the existing set. Use this when incrementally granting new capabilities to existing keys.

      summary: Remove roles from an API key
      description: |-
        Removes one or more roles from an existing API key, selectively revoking role-based access without affecting other assigned roles. When a role is removed, all permissions granted exclusively through that role are revoked, while permissions also granted through remaining roles or direct assignments remain accessible.

        The operation is idempotent, meaning removing roles multiple times has no additional effect. All specified roles are removed atomically or none are with rollback on failure. Changes take effect immediately for new verifications, though cached sessions may retain old permissions briefly (typically under 30 seconds) due to cache invalidation across all regions.

        This endpoint complements addRoles for granting access and setRoles for complete replacement. Use this when you need to selectively revoke specific roles without altering other role assignments, providing precise control over role-based access management.

      summary: Update remaining credits for an API key
      description: |-
        Sets the remaining number of credits for a key, providing precise control over usage limits for implementing usage-based business models. Use this endpoint when customers make purchases to add credits, during subscription renewals to reset credits, or for adjustments due to refunds and promotions.

        The credits feature provides globally consistent usage limiting where each successful verification decrements the counter by the specified cost value (default 1). When credits reach zero, verification fails with `code=USAGE_EXCEEDED`, making this ideal for monetization models where accuracy is critical compared to rate limits which control frequency.

        This endpoint works alongside `createKey` for setting initial credits and the automatic refill system for periodic replenishment. You can optionally remove automatic refill settings from the key, effectively converting it from periodic refills to fixed credit allocation. Common scenarios include implementing free trial extensions, granting bonus credits as incentives, or converting between subscription models.

      description: |-
        Replaces all existing direct role assignments on a key with the provided set of roles. This endpoint offers complete control over a key's role assignments in a single operation.

        Unlike incremental endpoints like addRoles or removeRoles, setRoles performs a wholesale replacement that completely resets a key's roles to the specified set. This makes it ideal for synchronizing key roles with external systems, applying standardized role templates to keys, or implementing role-based access control with predictable outcomes.

        All existing direct role assignments not included in the request will be removed, making this a complete replacement operation rather than an incremental update. The operation is atomic where all roles are set or none are with rollback on failure, and changes take effect immediately for new verifications with all role changes logged in the audit log for security tracking.

        After roles are set, cached versions of the key are immediately invalidated to ensure consistency, though existing verification sessions may retain old roles briefly (typically under 30 seconds). Only direct role assignments are affected, not roles granted through other mechanisms.

      summary: Update API key properties without changing the key itself
      description: |-
        Modifies the properties of an existing API key without changing the key string itself. This endpoint supports partial updates - you only need to include the fields you want to change.

        You can use this endpoint to:
        - Rename keys for better organization
        - Update metadata to reflect changes in user status, plan, or properties
        - Modify usage limits or rate limits
        - Enable or disable keys temporarily
        - Change key expiration dates
        - Add or update user identifiers

        To explicitly remove/disable a feature, set its field to null. Fields not included in the request remain unchanged. For managing permissions or roles, use the specialized endpoints (keys.addPermissions, keys.removePermissions, etc.) instead.

        Changes may take up to 30 seconds to propagate to all regions due to cache invalidation. For immediate effect in the current region, follow the update with a verification request.

      summary: Delete an API key
      description: |-
        Permanently deletes an API key, preventing it from being used for future verification attempts. This endpoint is used when a key is no longer needed, has been compromised, or needs to be revoked.

        When a key is deleted:
        - Verification attempts will fail with `code=NOT_FOUND`
        - The key no longer appears in API key listings
        - Historical verification data is preserved for analytics

        This endpoint supports two deletion modes:
        - Soft deletion (default): Marks the key as deleted but preserves its data
        - Permanent deletion: Completely removes all traces of the key from the database

        Permanent deletion is useful for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR), resolving hash collisions during migrations, or when you need to reuse the same key string in the future.

            are completely removed.

        Retrieves comprehensive information about a specific API key by its ID. This endpoint provides access to all key properties, metadata, permissions, and usage limits.

        This is particularly useful for:
        - Displaying key details in administrative interfaces
        - Checking key configuration before making updates
        - Retrieving metadata associated with a key
        - Verifying permissions and role assignments
        - Checking expiration dates and usage limits

        With appropriate permissions and if the key was created with the recoverable option, this endpoint can also return the complete plaintext key value, though this should be used with caution for security reasons.

      summary: Create a new API key with customizable security features
      description: |-
        Creates a new API key with configurable security properties, usage limits, and metadata. This endpoint generates a cryptographically secure key that you can distribute to your users for authenticating with your API.

        The key is only returned once in the response - Unkey stores only a secure hash of the key, not the key itself. You must provide this key directly to your end user; it cannot be retrieved later (unless created with `recoverable: true`, which is less secure).

        Keys are associated with a specific API (via `apiId`), which helps isolate environments (dev/staging/prod) and prevents keys from being used across different services. Keys can be further configured with:
        - Optional prefixes for visual identification
        - Expiration dates for temporary access
        - Usage limits (credits) for consumption-based APIs
        - Rate limits for abuse prevention
        - Permissions and roles for granular access control
        - Metadata for storing context with the key

        Best practices include using environment-specific API IDs, meaningful prefixes, appropriate byte length for security needs, and avoiding storing keys in your databases.

        - ratelimit
      summary: Apply rate limiting to any identifier
      description: |-
        Checks and enforces rate limits for any identifier in your application. This is the core rate limiting endpoint that provides flexible, namespace-based rate limiting for any entity in your system.

        Unlike API key-based rate limiting, this endpoint can be used to limit any identifiable entity:
        - Anonymous users by IP address
        - Authenticated users by user ID
        - Organizations by organization ID
        - API clients by client ID
        - Specific actions or resources by custom identifiers

        The endpoint is designed for high-performance rate limiting with predictable behavior. It returns information about limit status, remaining capacity, and reset times that can be communicated to consumers of your API or service.

        Features:
        - Namespace-based organization for different limit types
        - Custom costs for variable-weight operations
        - Flexible time windows (1 second to 24 hours)
        - Override support for custom limits for specific identifiers
        - Consistent sliding window implementation

        Implementation tips:
        - Always check the 'success' field to determine if the request should proceed
        - Use the 'reset' time to implement intelligent client-side retry logic
        - Leverage the 'remaining' count to display usage information to users
        - Store the namespaceId after first use to avoid name lookups in high-volume scenarios
        - Consider using smaller durations for security-critical operations

        Creates a new role in the workspace with optional permission assignments. Roles are collections of permissions that can be assigned to API keys, providing a convenient way to manage access control at scale.

        Roles enable you to group related permissions together for easier management, assign consistent permission sets to multiple API keys, and implement role-based access control patterns that simplify permission management as your system grows. When creating a role, you can optionally assign existing permissions to it immediately, and the role becomes available for assignment to API keys as soon as it's created.

        Use roles to establish standardized access patterns in your application, making it easier to maintain consistent security policies across many API keys while reducing the complexity of individual permission management.

      description: |-
        Creates a new or updates an existing rate limit override for specific identifiers within a namespace.

        Overrides allow you to implement special rate limiting rules that differ from the default limits. This is essential for:

        - Creating tiered rate limits for different customer segments
        - Implementing premium tiers with higher limits
        - Applying stricter limits to suspicious or abusive users
        - Setting emergency limits during system stress
        - Creating customized rate limiting policies

        When an override exists, it completely replaces the default rate limit for matching identifiers. The override takes effect immediately and will be applied to the very next rate limit check that matches the identifier pattern.

        Wildcard patterns can be used to create powerful matching rules that apply to groups of identifiers without having to create individual overrides for each one.

      summary: Create a new identity for resource sharing across keys
      description: |-
        Creates a new identity that can be associated with multiple API keys to enable resource sharing.

        Identities are a powerful concept in Unkey that allow multiple API keys to share resources like rate limits and to be associated with the same entity (user, organization, etc.). This is essential for:

        - Implementing consistent rate limiting across multiple API keys
        - Associating multiple keys with the same user or organization
        - Sharing metadata across all keys for an entity
        - Enabling user-based analytics across multiple keys
        - Simplifying key management for multi-device or multi-service users

        When you create keys with the same externalId, they'll share rate limits and appear grouped in analytics. This enables scenarios like letting users generate multiple API keys for different devices while still treating them as a single entity for usage limits.

        The identity concept creates a separation between your user entities and their authentication credentials (API keys), similar to how users can have multiple passwords or sessions.

      summary: Delete an existing identity
      description: |-
        Permanently removes an identity from your workspace. This operation cannot be undone.

        Deleting an identity has several important effects:
        - All metadata associated with the identity is permanently removed
        - Any rate limit history for this identity is cleared
        - The identity's externalId becomes available for reuse
        - Keys remain functional but lose their identity association

        Important notes:
        - This operation does NOT delete or disable any API keys associated with this identity
        - After deletion, keys previously linked to this identity will function independently
        - Rate limits that were shared across keys via this identity will no longer be shared
        - The externalId can be reused immediately after deletion

        Use this endpoint for compliance with data deletion requirements, cleaning up test data, or when an entity (user, organization) is permanently removed from your system.

      description: |-
        Creates a new permission in the workspace. Permissions are the fundamental building blocks of access control in Unkey's RBAC system, representing specific actions or capabilities that can be granted to API keys either directly or through roles.

        This endpoint allows you to:
        - Define new permissions with descriptive names and URL-safe slugs
        - Set up granular access control for your API keys
        - Build the foundation for role-based access control
        - Organize permissions with consistent naming patterns

        Best practices:
        - Use hierarchical naming (e.g., 'resource.action' or 'resource.subresource.action')
        - Choose descriptive but concise permission names
        - Use URL-safe slugs for easy reference in APIs

      summary: Delete a role
      description: |-
        Permanently removes a role from the workspace. This endpoint is used when a role is no longer needed or needs to be replaced with a different role structure.

        When a role is deleted:
        - All keys that had this role assigned will lose the permissions granted by this role
        - The role will no longer appear in role listings
        - The role's name becomes available for reuse

        Important: This operation cannot be undone, and it immediately affects all API keys that had this role assigned. Consider carefully before deleting roles that are actively in use by many keys.

      summary: Retrieve details about a specific role
      description: |-
        Retrieves detailed information about a specific role by its ID, including all permissions assigned to the role. This endpoint allows you to inspect a role's properties and understand what permissions it grants.

        This is useful for:
        - Verifying a role exists before assigning it to API keys
        - Retrieving role details for display in administrative interfaces
        - Checking role configuration before making updates
        - Building role management tools
        - Understanding the complete permission set granted by a role

        Roles are collections of permissions that can be assigned to API keys, providing a convenient way to manage access control at scale in Unkey's RBAC system.

      summary: Create a new API namespace for organizing keys
      description: |-
        Creates a new API namespace that serves as a container for related API keys.

        APIs in Unkey provide important functionality:
        - They organize keys into logical groups for easier management
        - They isolate keys between different environments (dev/staging/production)
        - They enforce security boundaries between services or products
        - They provide a foundation for permission scoping and access control

        Common use cases for creating separate APIs include:
        - Separating development, staging, and production environments
        - Isolating different services or microservices from each other
        - Creating boundaries between different products or teams
        - Implementing multi-tenant isolation for SaaS applications

        You'll use the resulting API ID when creating keys to associate them with this API namespace. During key verification, you must provide the same API ID to ensure keys can't be used across different environments or services.

      summary: Delete an API and invalidate all its associated keys
      description: |-
        Permanently deletes an API namespace and invalidates all keys associated with it.

        WARNING: This is a destructive operation with significant consequences:
        - All keys associated with this API will be invalidated immediately
        - Verification attempts for these keys will fail with `code=NOT_FOUND`
        - Historical analytics data for the API and its keys will be preserved
        - This action cannot be undone

        Common reasons to delete an API include:
        - Removing test or development environments no longer needed
        - Retiring deprecated services or products
        - Cleaning up unused resources
        - Implementing security isolation after compromise

        Before deletion, ensure that:
        - You have the correct API ID (check the environment/service)
        - You have migrated any needed keys to a new API
        - You have updated all client applications to use new keys
        - You have backed up any important metadata or analytics

        Checks if the Unkey API service is functioning correctly and ready to handle requests. Returns a simple health status that load balancers, monitoring tools, and orchestration systems can use to verify service availability.

        This endpoint requires no authentication and has minimal processing overhead for fast health verification. The response indicates whether the service can process requests normally or if there are issues requiring attention. Monitor this endpoint to detect service degradation and implement automated failover or alerting when the service becomes unhealthy.

            This indicates a significant issue with the service that requires attention.
            Clients should refrain from making other API calls as they are likely
            to fail. Monitoring systems should trigger alerts when receiving this

      summary: Verify an API key's validity and permissions
      description: |-
        This is the core endpoint for authenticating and authorizing API key usage in your application. It checks if a key is valid, hasn't expired, has sufficient remaining credits, isn't rate limited, and has the required permissions.

        When a key is verified, several checks occur:
        - Key existence and format validation
        - Expiration check
        - Enabled/disabled status verification
        - Credits deduction (if configured)
        - Rate limit enforcement (if configured)
        - Permission verification (if requested)

        This endpoint is designed for high-performance verification with global edge caching. Use it in your API authentication middleware to protect your endpoints. For high-volume applications, consider enabling async rate limiting for improved performance at the cost of slightly reduced accuracy.

        Unlike most other endpoints, this one does not require authentication with a root key.

      summary: Update an existing identity
      description: |-
        Updates an existing identity's metadata and rate limits with support for partial updates. You can modify the metadata to reflect changes in user status, subscription plans, or other entity properties, and adjust rate limits to match new usage tiers or requirements.

        This endpoint supports flexible identification using either the Unkey identity ID or your external ID, making it easy to integrate with existing user management systems. Fields not included in the request remain unchanged, allowing for targeted updates without affecting other identity properties.

        Changes to rate limits take effect immediately for new API key verifications, though existing sessions may retain old limits briefly due to caching. When updating metadata, consider that this information is returned during key verification, so avoid storing sensitive data that shouldn't be exposed to client applications.

        Common use cases include updating user plan information after subscription changes, adjusting rate limits for different service tiers, and maintaining current contact or organizational information associated with the identity.
