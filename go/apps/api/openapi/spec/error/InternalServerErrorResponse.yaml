  Error response when an unexpected error occurs on the server. This indicates a problem with Unkey's systems rather than your request.

  When you encounter this error:
  - The request ID in the response can help Unkey support investigate the issue
  - The error is likely temporary and retrying may succeed
  - If the error persists, contact Unkey support with the request ID
