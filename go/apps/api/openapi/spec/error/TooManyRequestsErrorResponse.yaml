description: |-
  Error response when the client has sent too many requests in a given time period. This occurs when you've exceeded a rate limit or quota for the resource you're accessing.

  The rate limit resets automatically after the time window expires. To avoid this error:
  - Implement exponential backoff when retrying requests
  - Cache results where appropriate to reduce request frequency
  - Check the error detail message for specific quota information
  - Contact support if you need a higher quota for your use case
