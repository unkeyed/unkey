        description: List of individual validation errors that occurred in the
          request. Each error provides specific details about what failed validation,
          where the error occurred in the request, and suggestions for fixing
          it. This granular information helps developers quickly identify and
          resolve multiple issues in a single request without having to make repeated
          API calls.

  This builds on the BaseError structure by adding an array of individual validation
  errors, making it easy to identify and fix multiple issues at once.
