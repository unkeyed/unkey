  Error response when the provided credentials are valid but lack sufficient permissions for the requested operation. This occurs when:
  - The root key doesn't have the required permissions for this endpoint
  - The operation requires elevated privileges that the current key lacks
  - Access to the requested resource is restricted based on workspace settings

  To resolve this error, ensure your root key has the necessary permissions or contact your workspace administrator.
