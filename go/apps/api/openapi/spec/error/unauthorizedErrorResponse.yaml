  Error response when authentication has failed or credentials are missing. This occurs when:
  - No authentication token is provided in the request
  - The provided token is invalid, expired, or malformed
  - The token format doesn't match expected patterns

  To resolve this error, ensure you're including a valid root key in the Authorization header.
