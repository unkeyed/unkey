  Error response when one or more conditions specified in the request headers are not met. This typically occurs when:
  - Using conditional requests with If-Match or If-None-Match headers
  - The resource version doesn't match the expected value
  - Optimistic concurrency control detects a conflict

  To resolve this error, fetch the latest version of the resource and retry with updated conditions.
