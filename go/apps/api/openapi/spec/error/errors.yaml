  description: Error response for invalid requests that cannot be processed due
    to client-side errors. This typically occurs when request parameters are missing,
    malformed, or fail validation rules. The response includes detailed information
    about the specific errors in the request, including the location of each error
    and suggestions for fixing it. When receiving this error, check the 'errors'
    array in the response for specific validation issues that need to be addressed
    before retrying.

    Error response when authentication has failed or credentials are missing. This occurs when:
    - The Authorization header is missing
    - The root key is invalid or has been revoked
    - The root key format is incorrect
    - The authentication token has expired
    To fix this error:
    1. Ensure you're including the `Authorization` header with format: `Bearer your_root_key`
    2. Verify your root key is valid and has not been revoked in the Unkey dashboard
    3. Check that you're using the correct root key for the environment
    4. If using a new key, ensure it was created successfully
    For security reasons, the specific reason for authentication failure may be intentionally vague in the error message. Check your Unkey dashboard for more detailed information about your root keys.

    Error response when the caller is authenticated but lacks permission to perform the requested operation. This occurs when:
    - The root key doesn't have the required permissions for the operation
    - The caller is trying to access resources from a different workspace
    - The caller is attempting to access another user's resources
    - The operation violates a policy restriction
    Unlike Unauthorized (401) which indicates authentication issues, Forbidden (403) indicates authorization problems for an authenticated caller.
    To fix this error:
    1. Check the permissions assigned to your root key in the Unkey dashboard
    2. Verify you're operating within the correct workspace
    3. Ensure you have the necessary scope to access the requested resource
    4. Request additional permissions if needed from your workspace administrator
    Permission patterns in Unkey follow a hierarchical structure:
    - 'resource.*' grants all permissions for a resource
    - 'resource.read' grants read-only access
    - 'resource.write' grants write access

    error:
      $ref: "./base.yaml#/BaseError"
  description: Error response when the requested resource cannot be found. This
    typically indicates that the resource either doesn't exist, has been deleted,
    or the caller doesn't have permission to see it. Common scenarios include
    looking up non-existent keys, APIs, permissions, or identities. When receiving
    this error, verify that the resource identifier is correct and that the resource
    hasn't been deleted.

    error:

  description:
    Error response for conflicts with the current state of a resource.
    This typically occurs when trying to create a resource that already exists
    (like an identity with a duplicate externalId) or when performing an operation
    that would violate system constraints. The error detail will explain the specific
    conflict. To resolve, check if the resource already exists or if the operation
    would create an inconsistent state.

    error:
      $ref: "./base.yaml#/BaseError"
  description: Error response for unexpected server-side issues that prevented
    the request from being processed correctly. This is typically caused by problems
    with Unkey's infrastructure rather than issues with your request. When encountering
    this error, the best course of action is to retry the request after a short
    delay. If the problem persists, contact Unkey support with the requestId for
    investigation. These errors are monitored by Unkey's engineering team and are
    typically resolved quickly.
