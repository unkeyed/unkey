  summary: Retrieve details about a specific permission
  description: |-
    Retrieves detailed information about a specific permission by its ID. This endpoint allows you to inspect a permission's properties, including its name, description, and workspace association.
    This is useful for:
    - Verifying a permission exists before assigning it
    - Retrieving permission details for display in administrative interfaces
    - Checking permission configuration before making updates
    - Building permission management tools
    Permissions are the fundamental building blocks of access control in Unkey's RBAC system, representing specific capabilities that can be granted to API keys either directly or through roles.
