  summary: Retrieve details about a specific role
  description: |-
    Retrieves detailed information about a specific role by its ID, including all permissions assigned to the role. This endpoint allows you to inspect a role's properties and understand what permissions it grants.
    This is useful for:
    - Verifying a role exists before assigning it to API keys
    - Retrieving role details for display in administrative interfaces
    - Checking role configuration before making updates
    - Building role management tools
    - Understanding the complete permission set granted by a role
    Roles are collections of permissions that can be assigned to API keys, providing a convenient way to manage access control at scale in Unkey's RBAC system.
