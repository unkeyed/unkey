  summary: List all roles in a workspace
  description: |-
    Retrieves a paginated list of all roles defined in the workspace, including their assigned permissions. This endpoint is essential for role-based access control (RBAC) administration.
    Roles are collections of permissions that can be assigned to API keys, providing a convenient way to manage access control at scale. This endpoint allows you to:
    - View all available roles for assignment
    - Inspect which permissions are granted by each role
    - Build role management interfaces
    - Audit your RBAC configuration
    Results are paginated and sorted alphabetically by role name. Each role includes its complete set of assigned permissions.
