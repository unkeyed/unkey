  summary: Create role
  description: |
    Create a new role to group related permissions for easier management. Roles enable consistent permission assignment across multiple API keys.

    **Important:** Role names must be unique within the workspace. Once created, roles are immediately available for assignment.

    **Required Permissions**
    
    Your root key must have the following permission:
    - `rbac.*.create_role`
  operationId: createRole
  x-speakeasy-name-override: CreateRole
  security:
    - rootKey: []
