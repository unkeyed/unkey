  summary: Delete a permission
  description: |-
    Permanently removes a permission from the workspace. This endpoint is used when a permission is no longer needed or when cleaning up unused permissions.
    When a permission is deleted:
    - All direct assignments to API keys are removed
    - The permission is removed from any roles it was assigned to
    - The permission's name becomes available for reuse
    Important: This operation cannot be undone, and it immediately affects all API keys and roles that had this permission assigned. Consider carefully before deleting permissions that are actively in use.
