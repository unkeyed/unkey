  summary: Delete a role
  description: |-
    Permanently removes a role from the workspace. This endpoint is used when a role is no longer needed or needs to be replaced with a different role structure.
    When a role is deleted:
    - All keys that had this role assigned will lose the permissions granted by this role
    - The role will no longer appear in role listings
    - The role's name becomes available for reuse
    Important: This operation cannot be undone, and it immediately affects all API keys that had this role assigned. Consider carefully before deleting roles that are actively in use by many keys.
