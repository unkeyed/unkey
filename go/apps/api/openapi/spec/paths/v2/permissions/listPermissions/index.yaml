  summary: List all permissions in a workspace
  description: |-
    Retrieves a paginated list of all permissions defined in the workspace. This endpoint is essential for permission management and RBAC administration.
    Permissions are the fundamental building blocks of access control in Unkey, representing specific actions or capabilities that can be granted to API keys either directly or through roles.
    This endpoint allows you to:
    - View all available permissions for assignment
    - Build permission management interfaces
    - Audit your RBAC configuration
    - Identify existing permissions before creating new ones
    Results are paginated and typically sorted alphabetically by permission name.
