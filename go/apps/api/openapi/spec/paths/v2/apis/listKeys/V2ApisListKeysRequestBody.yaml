  apiId:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    description: |
      The API namespace whose keys you want to list.
      Returns all keys in this API, subject to pagination and filters.
    example: api_1234abcd
  limit:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Maximum number of keys to return per request.
      Balance between response size and number of pagination calls needed.
    default: 100
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 100
  cursor:
    type: string
    description: |
      Pagination cursor from previous response to fetch next page.
      Use when `hasMore: true` in previous response.
    example: key_1234abcd
  externalId:
    type: string
    minLength: 3
    description: |
      Filter keys by external ID to find keys for a specific user or entity.
      Must exactly match the externalId set during key creation.
    example: user_1234abcd
  decrypt:
    type: boolean
    description: |-
      When true, attempts to include the plaintext key value in the response. SECURITY WARNING:
      - This requires special permissions on the calling root key
      - Only works for keys created with 'recoverable: true'
      - Exposes sensitive key material in the response
      - Should only be used in secure administrative contexts
      - Never enable this in user-facing applications
    default: false
  revalidateKeysCache:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |-
      EXPERIMENTAL: Skip the cache and fetch the keys directly from the database. This ensures you see the most recent state, including keys created moments ago. Use this when:
      - You've just created a key and need to display it immediately
      - You need absolute certainty about the current key state
      - You're debugging cache consistency issues

      This parameter comes with a performance cost and should be used sparingly.
