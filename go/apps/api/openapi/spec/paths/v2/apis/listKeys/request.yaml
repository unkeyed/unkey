      description: |-
        The ID of the API whose keys you want to list (begins with 'api_'). 
        This endpoint returns all keys associated with this specific API, subject to pagination and any additional filters provided.
      example: api_1234
    limit:
      type: integer
      description: |-
        The maximum number of keys to return in a single request. 
        Use this to control response size and loading performance. Higher values return more keys but may increase response time. 
        Lower values may require more pagination requests but provide faster initial loading.
      default: 100
      minimum: 1
      maximum: 100
    cursor:
      type: string
      description: |-
        Pagination cursor from a previous response. 
        Use this to fetch subsequent pages of results when the response contains hasMore=true. 
        Each response containing additional results will include a new cursor value in the pagination object.
      example: cursor_eyJsYXN0S2V5SWQiOiJrZXlfMjNld3MiLCJsYXN0Q3JlYXRlZEF0IjoxNjcyNTI0MjM0MDAwfQ==
    externalId:
      type: string
      minLength: 3
      description: |-
        Optional filter to return only keys associated with a specific external ID. 
        This is useful when you need to find all keys belonging to a particular user, organization, or entity in your system. 
        The value must exactly match the externalId set during key creation.
      example: user_5bf93ab218e

        When true, attempts to include the plaintext key value in the response. SECURITY WARNING:
        - This requires special permissions on the calling root key
        - Only works for keys created with 'recoverable: true'
        - Exposes sensitive key material in the response
        - Should only be used in secure administrative contexts
        - Never enable this in user-facing applications
      default: false
    revalidateKeysCache:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |-
        EXPERIMENTAL: Skip the cache and fetch the keys directly from the database. This ensures you see the most recent state, including keys created moments ago. Use this when:
        - You've just created a key and need to display it immediately
        - You need absolute certainty about the current key state
        - You're debugging cache consistency issues
        This parameter comes with a performance cost and should be used sparingly.
