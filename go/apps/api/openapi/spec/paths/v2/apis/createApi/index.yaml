  summary: Create API namespace
  description: |
    Create an API namespace for organizing keys by environment, service, or product.

    Use this to separate production from development keys, isolate different services, or manage multiple products. Each API gets a unique identifier and dedicated infrastructure for secure key operations.

    **Important**: API names must be unique within your workspace and cannot be changed after creation.

    **Required Permissions**

    Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
    - `api.*.create_api` (to create APIs in any workspace)
  operationId: createApi
  x-speakeasy-name-override: createApi
  security:
    - rootKey: []
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          "$ref": "./V2ApisCreateApiRequestBody.yaml"
    required: true
