  summary: Create a new API namespace for organizing keys
  description: |-
    Creates a new API namespace that serves as a container for related API keys.

    APIs in Unkey provide important functionality:
    - They organize keys into logical groups for easier management
    - They isolate keys between different environments (dev/staging/production)
    - They enforce security boundaries between services or products
    - They provide a foundation for permission scoping and access control

    Common use cases for creating separate APIs include:
    - Separating development, staging, and production environments
    - Isolating different services or microservices from each other
    - Creating boundaries between different products or teams
    - Implementing multi-tenant isolation for SaaS applications

    You'll use the resulting API ID when creating keys to associate them with this API namespace.
    During key verification, you must provide the same API ID to ensure keys can't be used across different environments or services.
