  summary: Retrieve information about an API namespace
  description: |-
    Retrieves detailed information about a specific API namespace.
    This endpoint is useful for:
    - Verifying an API exists before attempting to use it
    - Retrieving the name of an API when you only have its ID
    - Checking if you have access to a particular API
    - Confirming API details before performing operations on it

    The information returned is minimal by design, as APIs are primarily organizational containers. Most of the valuable data lies in the keys associated with an API, which can be retrieved using the apis.listKeys endpoint.
