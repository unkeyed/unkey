        Specifies which API to permanently delete from your workspace.
        Must be a valid API ID that begins with 'api_' and exists within your workspace.
        CRITICAL WARNING: Deletion is immediate and irreversible with severe consequences:
        - ALL keys associated with this API become invalid instantly
        - Verification requests for these keys will fail with `code=NOT_FOUND`
        - Client applications using these keys will lose access immediately
        - Analytics data and key metadata are permanently removed
        - This operation cannot be undone under any circumstances
        
        Before proceeding, ensure that:
        - You have identified the correct API (verify the ID and environment)
        - All necessary keys have been migrated to another API
        - All client applications have been updated with new keys
        - Any important metadata has been exported or backed up
        
        Common mistakes to avoid:
        - Deleting the wrong environment (production instead of staging)
        - Not updating client applications before deletion
        - Assuming deletion can be reversed (it cannot)
        
        For safety, consider using getApi first to verify the API name matches your expectations.
