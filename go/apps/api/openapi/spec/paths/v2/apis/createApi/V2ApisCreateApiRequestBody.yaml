      Creates an API with this name as an internal identifier for organization and isolation.
      APIs serve as containers for groups of keys and provide namespace separation between environments or services.
      Names must be unique within your workspace and are not shown to end users.

      Use descriptive names that clearly identify the API's purpose and environment:
      - Include environment indicators like 'production', 'staging', 'development'
      - Use service-based naming like 'payment-service', 'user-management', 'analytics'
      - Follow consistent naming conventions across your organization
      - Keep names concise but informative for easy identification

      Must start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens.
      Avoid generic names like 'api' or 'main' that don't provide meaningful context.
    example: payment-service-production
