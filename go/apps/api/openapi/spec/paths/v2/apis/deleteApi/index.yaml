  summary: Delete an API and invalidate all its associated keys
  description: |-
    Permanently deletes an API namespace and invalidates all keys associated with it.
    WARNING: This is a destructive operation with significant consequences:
    - All keys associated with this API will be invalidated immediately
    - Verification attempts for these keys will fail with `code=NOT_FOUND`
    - Historical analytics data for the API and its keys will be preserved
    - This action cannot be undone
    Common reasons to delete an API include:
    - Removing test or development environments no longer needed
    - Retiring deprecated services or products
    - Cleaning up unused resources
    - Implementing security isolation after compromise
    Before deletion, ensure that:
    - You have the correct API ID (check the environment/service)
    - You have migrated any needed keys to a new API
    - You have updated all client applications to use new keys
    - You have backed up any important metadata or analytics
