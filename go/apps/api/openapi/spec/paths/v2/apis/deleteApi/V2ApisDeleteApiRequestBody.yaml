      Specifies which API to permanently delete from your workspace.
      Must be a valid API ID that begins with 'api_' and exists within your workspace.

      CRITICAL WARNING: Deletion is immediate and irreversible with severe consequences:
      - ALL keys associated with this API become invalid instantly
      - Verification requests for these keys will fail with `code=NOT_FOUND`
      - Client applications using these keys will lose access immediately
      - Analytics data and key metadata are permanently removed
      - This operation cannot be undone under any circumstances

      Before proceeding, ensure you have:
      - Verified the correct API ID (double-check environment and service)
      - Migrated all active keys to alternative APIs
      - Updated all client applications to use replacement keys
      - Backed up critical analytics data and key configurations
      - Notified all stakeholders of the service interruption
      - Tested replacement systems in non-production environments

      Consider disabling keys first to test impact before permanent deletion.
