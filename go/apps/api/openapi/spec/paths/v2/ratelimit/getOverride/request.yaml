V2RatelimitGetOverrideRequestBody:
  description: |-
    Gets the configuration of an existing rate limit override. Use this to retrieve details about custom rate limit rules that have been created for specific identifiers within a namespace.
    This endpoint is useful for:
    - Verifying override configurations
    - Checking current limits for specific entities
    - Auditing rate limit policies
    - Debugging rate limiting behavior
    - Retrieving override settings for modification

  properties:
    namespaceId:
      description:
        The unique ID of the rate limit namespace. Either `namespaceId`
        or `namespaceName` must be provided, but not both. Using `namespaceId` is
        more precise and less prone to naming conflicts, making it ideal for scripts
        and automated operations.

    namespaceName:
      description:
        The name of the rate limit namespace. Either `namespaceId` or
        `namespaceName` must be provided, but not both. Using `namespaceName` is more
        human-readable and easier to work with for manual operations and configurations.

    identifier:
      description: |-
        The exact identifier pattern for the override you want to retrieve. This must match exactly as it was specified when creating the override.
        Important notes:
        - This is case-sensitive and must match exactly
        - Include any wildcards (*) that were part of the original pattern
        - For example, if the override was created for 'premium_*', you must use 'premium_*' here, not a specific ID like 'premium_user1'
        This field is used to look up the specific override configuration for this pattern.
