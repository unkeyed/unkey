      Sets how much of the rate limit quota this request consumes, enabling weighted rate limiting.
      Use higher values for resource-intensive operations and 0 for tracking without limiting.
      When accumulated cost exceeds the limit within the duration window, subsequent requests are rejected.
      Essential for implementing fair usage policies and preventing resource abuse through expensive operations.
    example: 5
  duration:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 1000 # 1 second minimum window
    maximum: 2592000000 # 30 days maximum window

      Sets the rate limit window duration in milliseconds after which the counter resets.
      Shorter durations enable faster recovery but may be less effective against sustained abuse.
      Common values include 60000 (1 minute), 3600000 (1 hour), and 86400000 (24 hours).
      Balance user experience with protection needs when choosing window sizes.
    example: 60000
  identifier:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    maxLength: 255 # Reasonable upper bound for identifiers
    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9_.:/-]+$"

      Defines the scope of rate limiting by identifying the entity being limited.
      Use user IDs for per-user limits, IP addresses for anonymous limiting, or API key IDs for per-key limits.
      Accepts letters, numbers, underscores, dots, colons, slashes, and hyphens for flexible identifier formats.
      The same identifier can be used across different namespaces to apply multiple rate limit types.
      Choose identifiers that provide appropriate granularity for your rate limiting strategy.
    example: "user_12345"
  limit:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 1000000 # Reasonable upper bound for rate limits
    description: |
      Sets the maximum operations allowed within the duration window before requests are rejected.
      When this limit is reached, subsequent requests fail with `RATE_LIMITED` until the window resets.
      Balance user experience with resource protection when setting limits for different user tiers.
      Consider system capacity, business requirements, and fair usage policies in limit determination.
