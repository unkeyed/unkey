      The exact identifier pattern for the override you want to retrieve. This must match exactly as it was specified when creating the override.

      Important notes:
      - This is case-sensitive and must match exactly
      - Include any wildcards (*) that were part of the original pattern
      - For example, if the override was created for 'premium_*', you must use 'premium_*' here, not a specific ID like 'premium_user1'

      This field is used to look up the specific override configuration for this pattern.
