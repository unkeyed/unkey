  Gets the configuration of an existing rate limit override. Use this to retrieve details about custom rate limit rules that have been created for specific identifiers within a namespace.

  This endpoint is useful for:
  - Verifying override configurations
  - Checking current limits for specific entities
  - Auditing rate limit policies
  - Debugging rate limiting behavior
  - Retrieving override settings for modification

properties:
  namespaceId:
    description: The unique ID of the rate limit namespace. Either `namespaceId`
      or `namespaceName` must be provided, but not both. Using `namespaceId` is
      more precise and less prone to naming conflicts, making it ideal for scripts
      and automated operations.

  namespaceName:
    description: The name of the rate limit namespace. Either `namespaceId` or
      `namespaceName` must be provided, but not both. Using `namespaceName` is more
      human-readable and easier to work with for manual operations and configurations.

  identifier:
    description: |-
      The exact identifier pattern for the override you want to retrieve. This must match exactly as it was specified when creating the override.

      Important notes:
      - This is case-sensitive and must match exactly
      - Include any wildcards (*) that were part of the original pattern
      - For example, if the override was created for 'premium_*', you must use 'premium_*' here, not a specific ID like 'premium_user1'

      This field is used to look up the specific override configuration for this pattern.
