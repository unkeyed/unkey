  Deletes an existing rate limit override. This permanently removes a custom rate limit rule, reverting affected identifiers back to the default rate limits for the namespace.

  Use this endpoint when you need to:
  - Remove special rate limit rules that are no longer needed
  - Reset entities back to standard rate limits
  - Clean up temporary overrides
  - Remove outdated tiering or custom limit rules
  - Fix misconfigured overrides

  Once deleted, the override cannot be recovered, and the operation takes effect immediately.

      The exact identifier pattern of the override to delete. This must match exactly as it was specified when creating the override.

      Important notes:
      - This is case-sensitive and must match exactly
      - Include any wildcards (*) that were part of the original pattern
      - For example, if the override was created for 'premium_*', you must use 'premium_*' here, not a specific ID

      After deletion, any identifiers previously affected by this override will immediately revert to using the default rate limit for the namespace.
