  namespaceId:
    description: The unique ID of the rate limit namespace to list overrides
      for. Either `namespaceId` or `namespaceName` must be provided, but not both.
      Using `namespaceId` guarantees you're targeting the exact namespace intended,
      even if names change over time.

  namespaceName:
    description: The name of the rate limit namespace to list overrides for.
      Either `namespaceId` or `namespaceName` must be provided, but not both. Using
      `namespaceName` is more human-readable and convenient for manual operations
      and dashboards.
    type: string
  cursor:
    description: Pagination cursor from a previous response. Include this when
      fetching subsequent pages of results. Each response containing more results
      than the requested limit will include a cursor value in the pagination
      object that can be used here.
    type: string
  limit:
    description: |-
      Maximum number of override entries to return in a single response. Use this to control response size and loading performance.

      - Lower values (10-20): Better for UI displays and faster response times
      - Higher values (50-100): Better for data exports or bulk operations
      - Default (10): Suitable for most dashboard views

      Results exceeding this limit will be paginated, with a cursor provided for fetching subsequent pages.
