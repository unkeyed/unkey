  summary: Retrieve identity information
  description: |-
    Retrieves detailed information about a specific identity by its external ID.
    Identities in Unkey represent entities in your system (users, organizations, etc.) that can be associated with multiple API keys. This endpoint provides access to:
    - Identity metadata that was stored during creation
    - Rate limiting configurations that apply across all keys for this identity
    This endpoint is useful for:
    - Checking if an identity exists
    - Retrieving metadata associated with an identity
    - Viewing rate limit configurations
    You must provide the externalId parameter to identify which identity to retrieve.
