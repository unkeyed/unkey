  summary: Delete Identity
  description: |

    Use this for data cleanup, compliance requirements, or when removing entities from your system.

    > **Important**  
    > Requires `identity.*.delete_identity` permission  
    > Associated API keys remain functional but lose shared resources  
    > External ID becomes available for reuse immediately
