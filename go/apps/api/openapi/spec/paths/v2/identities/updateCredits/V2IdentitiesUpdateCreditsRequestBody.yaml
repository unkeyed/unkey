    description: The ID of the identity to update. Accepts either the externalId (your system-generated identifier) or the identityId (internal identifier returned by the identity service). This uniquely identifies which identity's credits will be updated across all associated keys.

    description: |
      The credit value to use with the specified operation. The meaning depends on the operation: for 'set', this becomes the new remaining credits value; for 'increment', this amount is added to current credits; for 'decrement', this amount is subtracted from current credits.

      Set to null when using 'set' operation to make the identity unlimited (removes usage restrictions entirely). When decrementing, if the result would be negative, remaining credits are automatically set to zero. Credits are consumed during successful key verification for keys associated with this identity, and when credits reach zero, verification fails with `code=INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`.

      Required when using 'increment' or 'decrement' operations. Optional for 'set' operation (null creates unlimited usage).
