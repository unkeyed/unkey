  summary: List identities in your workspace
  description: |-
    Retrieves a paginated list of identities in your workspace. Identities represent entities in your system (users, organizations, etc.) that can be associated with multiple API keys for resource sharing.
    This endpoint allows you to:
    - Browse all identities in your workspace
    - Search for specific identities by environment
    - View rate limits configured for each identity
    - Implement identity management interfaces
    Results are paginated if there are more identities than the specified limit. Use the returned cursor to fetch subsequent pages.
