  summary: Check service health and availability
  description: |-
    Checks if the Unkey API service is functioning correctly and ready to handle requests. Returns a simple health status that load balancers, monitoring tools, and orchestration systems can use to verify service availability.

    This endpoint requires no authentication and has minimal processing overhead for fast health verification. The response indicates whether the service can process requests normally or if there are issues requiring attention. Monitor this endpoint to detect service degradation and implement automated failover or alerting when the service becomes unhealthy.

        This indicates a significant issue with the service that requires attention.
        Clients should refrain from making other API calls as they are likely
        to fail. Monitoring systems should trigger alerts when receiving this
        response.
