  summary: Update API key properties without changing the key itself
  description: |-
    Modifies the properties of an existing API key without changing the key string itself. This endpoint supports partial updates - you only need to include the fields you want to change.

    You can use this endpoint to:
    - Rename keys for better organization
    - Update metadata to reflect changes in user status, plan, or properties
    - Modify usage limits or rate limits
    - Enable or disable keys temporarily
    - Change key expiration dates
    - Add or update user identifiers

    To explicitly remove/disable a feature, set its field to null. Fields not included in the request remain unchanged. For managing permissions or roles, use the specialized endpoints (keys.addPermissions, keys.removePermissions, etc.) instead.

    Changes may take up to 30 seconds to propagate to all regions due to cache invalidation. For immediate effect in the current region, follow the update with a verification request.
