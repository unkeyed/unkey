  Complete list of all roles directly assigned to the key after the removal operation completes.

  The response includes:
  - The remaining roles still assigned to the key (after removing the specified roles)
  - Both ID and name for each role for easy reference
  - Roles sorted alphabetically by name for consistent response format

  Important notes:
  - The response reflects the current state after the removal operation
  - An empty array indicates the key now has no roles assigned
  - This only shows direct role assignments
  - Role permissions are not expanded in this response - use keys.getKey for full details
  - All role changes are logged in the audit log for security tracking
  - Changes take effect immediately for new verifications but cached sessions may retain old permissions briefly
