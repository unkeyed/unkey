  summary: Verify an API key's validity and permissions
  description: |-
    This is the core endpoint for authenticating and authorizing API key usage in your application. It checks if a key is valid, hasn't expired, has sufficient remaining credits, isn't rate limited, and has the required permissions.
    When a key is verified, several checks occur:
    - Key existence and format validation
    - Expiration check
    - Enabled/disabled status verification
    - Permission validation (if required)
    - Rate limit enforcement
    - Credit consumption (if configured)
    The response includes detailed information about the key's status, remaining resources, and metadata to help your application make authorization decisions.
