      description: |
        The API key to verify. This is the actual key string that your users authenticate with.
        Can include prefixes (e.g., 'prod_xxxxx') and should be provided exactly as given to the user.
      example: prod_1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
    permissions:
      type: string
      minLength: 1
      maxLength: 1000 # Allow for complex permission queries
      pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9_.()\\s-]+$"
      description: |
        Checks if the key has the specified permission(s) using a query syntax.
        Supports single permissions, logical operators (AND, OR), and parentheses for grouping.
        Examples:
        - Single permission: "documents.read"
        - Multiple permissions: "documents.read AND documents.write"
        - Complex queries: "(documents.read OR documents.write) AND users.view"
        Verification fails if the key lacks the required permissions through direct assignment or role inheritance.
      example: "documents.read AND users.view"

            Sets how many credits to deduct for this verification request.
            Use 0 for read-only operations or free tier access, higher values for premium features.
            Credits are deducted immediately upon verification, even if the key lacks required permissions.
            Essential for implementing usage-based pricing with different operation costs.
          example: 5
      description: |
        Controls credit consumption for usage-based billing and quota enforcement.
        When specified, the cost is deducted from the key's remaining credits.
        Verification fails if the key doesn't have sufficient credits remaining.
