  summary: Set (replace) all permissions on an API key
  description: |-
    Sets the permissions for an existing API key by replacing all existing direct permissions with the provided set. This is a complete replacement operation - permissions not specified in the request will be removed.
    Use this endpoint when you want to:
    - Synchronize API key permissions with an external system
    - Reset a key's permissions to a known state
    - Apply a standardized permission template to a key
    - Remove all permissions from a key (by providing an empty array)
    - Fix over-permissioned keys by applying the precise set needed
    Key differences from other endpoints:
    - Unlike addPermissions, this replaces all permissions instead of just adding
    - Unlike removePermissions, this sets the complete state rather than removing specific permissions
    - The advantage is atomic replacement in a single operation versus multiple incremental changes
    Only direct permissions are affected - permissions granted through roles remain unchanged. Changes take effect immediately for new verifications, though existing authorized sessions may continue until their cache expires (typically under 30 seconds).
