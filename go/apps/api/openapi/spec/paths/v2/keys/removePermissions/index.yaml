  summary: Remove permissions from an API key
  description: |-
    Removes one or more permissions from an existing API key. This endpoint is used to selectively revoke access rights from a key without deleting it or affecting other permissions.
    Key features:
    - Selective removal - revoke specific permissions while leaving others intact
    - Direct permissions only - doesn't affect permissions granted through roles
    - Idempotent operation - removing permissions multiple times has no additional effect
    Use this endpoint when downgrading user access privileges, removing temporary elevated permissions, implementing granular permission adjustments, or revoking access to specific resources.
