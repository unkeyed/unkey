      Specifies which key to remove permissions from using the database identifier returned from `keys.createKey`.
      Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.
      Removing permissions only affects direct assignments, not permissions inherited from roles.
      Permission changes take effect immediately but may take up to 30 seconds to propagate across all regions.
    example: key_2cGKbMxRyIzhCxo1Idjz8q
  permissions:
    type: array
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 1000 # Allow extensive permission sets for complex applications

      Removes direct permissions from the key without affecting role-based permissions.
      Operations are idempotent - removing non-existent permissions has no effect and causes no errors.
      Use either ID for existing permissions or name for exact string matching.

      After removal, verification checks for these permissions will fail unless granted through roles.
      Permission changes take effect immediately but cache propagation across regions may take up to 30 seconds.
      Removing all direct permissions does not disable the key, only removes its direct permission grants.

            References the permission to remove by its database identifier.
            Use when you know the exact permission ID and want to ensure you're removing a specific permission.
            Takes precedence over name when both are provided in the same object.
            Essential for automation scripts where precision prevents accidental permission removal.

            Identifies the permission by slug for removal from the key's direct assignment list.
