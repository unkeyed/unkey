  summary: Add roles to an API key
  description: |-
    Adds one or more roles to an existing API key without affecting existing roles or permissions. This is an additive operation that supplements the key's current role assignments.
    Use this endpoint when you need to grant additional role-based access to a key, such as promoting user privileges or enabling new feature sets through role inheritance.
    Role assignments take effect immediately for new verifications, though existing authorized sessions may continue until their cache expires.
