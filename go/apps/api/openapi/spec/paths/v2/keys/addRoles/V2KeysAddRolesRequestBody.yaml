      Specifies which key receives the additional roles using the database identifier returned from `createKey`.
      Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.
      Added roles supplement existing roles and permissions without replacing them.
      Role assignments take effect immediately but may take up to 30 seconds to propagate across all regions.

    description: |
      Assigns additional roles to the key through direct assignment to existing workspace roles.
      Operations are idempotent - adding existing roles has no effect and causes no errors.

      All roles must already exist in the workspace - roles cannot be created automatically.
      Invalid roles cause the entire operation to fail atomically, ensuring consistent state.
