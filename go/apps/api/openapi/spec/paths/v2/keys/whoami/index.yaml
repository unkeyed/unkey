    Find out what key this is.

    **Required Permissions**

    Your root key must have one of the following permissions for basic key information:
    - `api.*.read_key` (to read keys from any API)
    - `api.<api_id>.read_key` (to read keys from a specific API)

    If your rootkey lacks permissions but the key exists, we may return a 404 status here to prevent leaking the existance of a key to unauthorized clients. If you believe that a key should exist, but receive a 404, please double check your root key has the correct permissions.
