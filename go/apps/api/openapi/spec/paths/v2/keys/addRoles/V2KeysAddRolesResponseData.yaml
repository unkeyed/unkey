  Complete list of all roles directly assigned to the key after the operation completes.

  The response includes:
  - All roles now assigned to the key (both pre-existing and newly added)
  - Both ID and name of each role for easy reference
  - Roles sorted alphabetically by name for consistent response format

  Important notes:
  - The response shows the complete current state after the addition
  - An empty array means the key has no roles assigned (unlikely after an add operation)
  - This only shows direct role assignments, not inherited or nested roles

      description: The unique identifier of the role (begins with `role_`).
        This ID can be used in other API calls to reference this specific role.
        Role IDs are immutable and guaranteed to be unique within your Unkey
        workspace, making them reliable reference points for integration and
        automation systems.

        access level (`admin`, `editor`, `viewer`), by department (`billing_manager`,
        `support_agent`), or by feature area (`analytics_user`, `dashboard_admin`).
