  Complete list of all roles directly assigned to the key after the operation completes.

  The response includes:
  - All roles now assigned to the key (both pre-existing and newly added)
  - Both ID and name of each role for easy reference

  Important notes:
  - The response shows the complete current state after the addition
  - An empty array means the key has no roles assigned (unlikely after an add operation)
  - This only shows direct role assignments, not inherited or nested roles
  - Role permissions are not expanded in this response - use keys.getKey for full details
