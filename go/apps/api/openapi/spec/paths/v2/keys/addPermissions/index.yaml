  summary: Add permissions to an API key
  description: |-
    Adds one or more permissions to an existing API key without affecting existing permissions or roles. This is an additive operation that supplements the key's current permission set.
    Use this endpoint when you need to grant additional access rights to a key, such as upgrading user privileges, enabling new features, or implementing progressive permission models.
    Only direct permissions are affected - permissions granted through roles remain unchanged. Changes take effect immediately for new verifications, though existing authorized sessions may continue until their cache expires.
