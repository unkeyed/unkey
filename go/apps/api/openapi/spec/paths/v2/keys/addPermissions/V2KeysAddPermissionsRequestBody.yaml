      Grants additional permissions to the key through direct assignment or automatic creation.
      Duplicate permissions are ignored automatically, making this operation idempotent.

      Adding permissions never removes existing permissions or role-based permissions.

      Any permissions that do not exist will be auto created if the root key has permissions, otherwise this operation will fail with a 403 error.
