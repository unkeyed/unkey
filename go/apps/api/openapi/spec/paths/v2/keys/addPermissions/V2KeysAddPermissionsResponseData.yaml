  Complete list of all permissions directly assigned to the key (including both newly added permissions and those that were already assigned).

  This response includes:
  - All direct permissions assigned to the key (both pre-existing and newly added)
  - Permissions sorted alphabetically by name for consistent response format
  - Both the permission ID and name for each permission

  Important notes:
  - This list does NOT include permissions granted through roles
  - For a complete permission picture, use `/v2/keys.getKey` instead
  - An empty array indicates the key has no direct permissions assigned

      description:
        The unique identifier of the permission (begins with `perm_`).
        This ID can be used in other API calls to reference this specific permission.
        IDs are guaranteed unique and won't change, making them ideal for scripting
        and automation. You can store these IDs in your system for consistent
        reference.
