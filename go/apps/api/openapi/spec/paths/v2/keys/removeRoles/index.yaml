  summary: Remove key roles
  description: |
    Remove roles from a key without affecting direct permissions or other roles.

    Use this for privilege downgrades, removing temporary access, or subscription changes that revoke specific role-based capabilities. Direct permissions remain unchanged.

    **Important**: Changes take effect immediately with up to 30-second edge propagation.

    **Required Permissions**

    Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
    - `api.*.update_key` (to update keys in any API)
    - `api.<api_id>.update_key` (to update keys in a specific API)

    **Side Effects**

    Invalidates the key cache for immediate effect, and makes role changes available for verification within 30 seconds across all regions.
