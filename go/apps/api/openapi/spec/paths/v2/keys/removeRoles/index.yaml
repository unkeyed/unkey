  summary: Remove roles from an API key
  description: |-
    Removes one or more roles from an existing API key. This endpoint is used to selectively revoke role-based access from a key without affecting direct permissions or other roles.
    Use this endpoint when downgrading user privileges, removing temporary role assignments, or implementing granular role management.
    Role changes take effect immediately for new verifications, though existing authorized sessions may continue until their cache expires.
