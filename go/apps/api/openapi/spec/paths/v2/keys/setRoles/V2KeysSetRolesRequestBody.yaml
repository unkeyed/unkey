      Specifies which key gets the complete role replacement using the database identifier returned from createKey.
      Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.
      This is a wholesale replacement operation that removes all existing roles not included in the request.
      Role changes take effect immediately but may take up to 30 seconds to propagate across all regions.

  roles:
    type: array
    maxItems: 100 # Reasonable limit for role assignments per key
    description: |
      Replaces all existing role assignments with this complete list of roles.
      This is a wholesale replacement operation, not an incremental update like add/remove operations.

      Providing an empty array removes all direct role assignments from the key.
      All roles must already exist in the workspace - roles cannot be created automatically.
      Invalid role references cause the entire operation to fail atomically, ensuring consistent state.
