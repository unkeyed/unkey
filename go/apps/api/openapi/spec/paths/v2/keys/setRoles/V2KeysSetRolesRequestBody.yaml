      Specifies which key gets the complete role replacement using the database identifier returned from createKey.
      Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.
      This is a wholesale replacement operation that removes all existing roles not included in the request.
      Role changes take effect immediately but may take up to 30 seconds to propagate across all regions.

  roles:
    type: array
    maxItems: 100 # Reasonable limit for role assignments per key
    description: |
      Replaces all existing role assignments with this complete list of roles.
      This is a wholesale replacement operation, not an incremental update like add/remove operations.
      Use either ID for existing roles or name for human-readable references.

      Providing an empty array removes all direct role assignments from the key.
      All roles must already exist in the workspace - roles cannot be created automatically.
      Invalid role references cause the entire operation to fail atomically, ensuring consistent state.
      Role changes take effect immediately but cache propagation across regions may take up to 30 seconds.

            References an existing role by its database identifier.
            Use when you know the exact role ID and want to ensure you're referencing a specific role.
            Takes precedence over name when both are provided in the same object.
            Essential for automation scripts where role names might change but IDs remain stable.

        name:
          type: string
          minLength: 1
          maxLength: 100 # Keep role names concise and readable
          pattern: "^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$"

            Identifies the role by its human-readable name within the workspace.
            Role names must start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.
            Names must be unique within the workspace and are case-sensitive.
            More readable than IDs but vulnerable to integration breaks if roles are renamed.
            Use IDs for automation and names for human-configured integrations.
          example: admin
      additionalProperties: false
additionalProperties: false
