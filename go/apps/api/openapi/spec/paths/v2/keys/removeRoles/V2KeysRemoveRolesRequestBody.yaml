      Specifies which key loses the roles using the database identifier returned from createKey.
      Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.
      Removing roles only affects direct assignments, not permissions inherited from other sources.
      Role changes take effect immediately but may take up to 30 seconds to propagate across all regions.
    example: key_2cGKbMxRyIzhCxo1Idjz8q
  roles:
    type: array
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 100 # Reasonable limit for role assignments per key
    description: |
      Removes direct role assignments from the key without affecting other role sources or permissions.
      Operations are idempotent - removing non-assigned roles has no effect and causes no errors.
      Use either ID for existing roles or name for exact string matching.

      After removal, the key loses access to permissions that were only granted through these roles.
      Role changes take effect immediately but cache propagation across regions may take up to 30 seconds.
      Invalid role references cause the entire operation to fail atomically, ensuring consistent state.

            References the role to remove by its database identifier.
            Use when you know the exact role ID and want to ensure you're removing a specific role.
            Takes precedence over name when both are provided in the same object.
            Essential for automation scripts where role names might change but IDs remain stable.
          example: role_1n9McEIBSqy44Qy7hzWyM5
        name:
          type: string
          minLength: 1
          maxLength: 100 # Keep role names concise and readable
          pattern: "^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$"
          description: |
            Identifies the role to remove by its exact name with case-sensitive matching.
            Must match the complete role name as currently defined in the workspace, starting with a letter and using only letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.
            More readable than IDs but vulnerable to integration breaks if roles are renamed.
            Use IDs for automation and names for human-configured integrations.
          example: admin
      additionalProperties: false
additionalProperties: false
