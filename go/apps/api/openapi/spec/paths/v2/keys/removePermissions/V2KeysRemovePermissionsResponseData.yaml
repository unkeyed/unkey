  Complete list of all permissions directly assigned to the key after the removal operation (remaining permissions only).

  Notes:
  - This list does NOT include permissions granted through roles
  - For a complete permission picture, use `/v2/keys.getKey` instead
  - An empty array indicates the key has no direct permissions assigned
  - Any cached versions of the key are immediately invalidated to ensure consistency
  - Changes to permissions take effect within seconds for new verifications
