        The unique identifier of the key to update credits for (begins with 'key_').
        This ID comes from the createKey response and identifies which key will have its credits updated.
        This is the database ID, not the actual API key string.
      example: key_2cGKbMxRyIzhCxo1Idjz8q
    value:
      type: integer
      format: int64
      nullable: true
      minimum: 0
      maximum: 9223372036854775807 # Max int64 value for future-proofing

        The new value for the remaining credits. This is an absolute value replacement, not an increment or decrement operation.

        Key behaviors:
        - This completely replaces the current remaining credits value when operation is set to 'set'
        - To add credits, either replace the current value with the new value or increment the current value by a new value
        - To make a key unlimited, set value = null
        - To make a key with unlimited usage have a specific limit, set remaining to a positive number
        - If a decrement would result in a negative value, the remaining credits are set to zero
        - Credits are decremented each time the key is successfully verified (by the cost value, default 1)
        - When credits reach zero, verification fails with code=USAGE_EXCEEDED

        This field is useful for implementing usage-based pricing, subscription tiers, trial periods, or consumption quotas.
      example: 1000
    operation:
      type: string
      enum:
        - set
        - increment
        - decrement

        The operation to perform on the remaining credits. This can be one of:
        - set: Replace the current remaining credits value with the specified value.
        - increment: Add the specified value to the current remaining credits value.
        - decrement: Subtract the specified value from the current remaining credits value.
