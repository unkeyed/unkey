  summary: Retrieve detailed information about a specific API key
  description: |-
    Retrieves comprehensive information about an API key including its configuration, permissions, roles, metadata, and usage limits. This endpoint is essential for key management, debugging, and building administrative interfaces.
    The response includes all key properties such as expiration dates, credit balances, rate limits, assigned permissions and roles, and any metadata stored with the key. This information helps administrators understand a key's current state and troubleshoot access issues.
    Note: The actual key value is never returned for security reasons, only the key's metadata and configuration.
