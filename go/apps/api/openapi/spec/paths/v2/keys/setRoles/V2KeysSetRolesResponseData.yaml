  The response includes:
  - The comprehensive, updated set of roles (reflecting the complete replacement)
  - Both ID and name for each role for easy reference
  - Roles sorted alphabetically by name for consistent response format

  Important notes:
  - This response shows the final state after the complete replacement
  - If you provided an empty array in the request, this will also be empty
  - This only shows direct role assignments on the key
  - Role permissions are not expanded in this response - use keys.getKey for complete details
  - An empty array indicates the key now has no roles assigned at all

      type: string
      description: The unique identifier of the role (begins with `role_`).
        This ID can be used in other API calls to reference this specific role.
        Role IDs are immutable and guaranteed to be unique, making them reliable
        reference points for integration and automation systems.

    name:
      type: string
      description: The name of the role. This is a human-readable identifier
        that's unique within your workspace. Role names are descriptive labels
        that help identify what access level or function a role provides. Good
        naming practices include naming by access level ('admin', 'editor'),
        by department ('billing_team', 'support_staff'), or by feature area
        ('reporting_user', 'settings_manager').
      example: admin
