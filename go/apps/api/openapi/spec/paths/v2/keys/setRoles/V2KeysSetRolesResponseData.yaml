  The response includes:
  - The comprehensive, updated set of roles (reflecting the complete replacement)
  - Both ID and name for each role for easy reference
  - Roles sorted alphabetically by name for consistent response format

  Important notes:
  - This response shows the final state after the complete replacement
  - If you provided an empty array in the request, this will also be empty
  - This only shows direct role assignments on the key
  - Role permissions are not expanded in this response - use keys.getKey for complete details
  - An empty array indicates the key now has no roles assigned at all
