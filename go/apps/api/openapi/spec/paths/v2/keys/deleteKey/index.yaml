  summary: Delete an API key permanently
  description: |-
    Permanently removes an API key from the system. Once deleted, the key becomes invalid immediately and cannot be used for any further authentication attempts.
    This operation is irreversible and will:
    - Immediately invalidate the key across all regions
    - Remove all associated permissions and roles
    - Clear any stored metadata
    - Stop any ongoing rate limit tracking
    - Remove the key from analytics and usage tracking
    Use this endpoint when deactivating user accounts, cleaning up test keys, or implementing key rotation policies. The key deletion is logged in the audit trail for security compliance.

        Successfully deleted key. The key will immediately fail verification
        in the current region, but it may take up to 30 seconds for deletion to
        propagate to all regions due to eventual consistency. After deletion,
        the key will no longer appear in key listings, and verification attempts
        will return `code=NOT_FOUND`. Soft-deleted keys (`permanent=false`) remain
        in the database but are marked as deleted, while permanently deleted keys
        are completely removed.
