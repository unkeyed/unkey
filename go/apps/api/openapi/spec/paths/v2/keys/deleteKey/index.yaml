  summary: Delete an API key permanently
  description: |-
    Permanently removes an API key from the system. Once deleted, the key becomes invalid immediately and cannot be used for any further authentication attempts.
    This operation is irreversible and will:
    - Immediately invalidate the key across all regions
    - Remove all associated permissions and roles
    - Clear any stored metadata
    - Stop any ongoing rate limit tracking
    - Remove the key from analytics and usage tracking
    Use this endpoint when deactivating user accounts, cleaning up test keys, or implementing key rotation policies. The key deletion is logged in the audit trail for security compliance.
