  summary: Set (replace) all roles on an API key
  description: |-
    Sets the roles for an existing API key by replacing all existing role assignments with the provided set. This is a complete replacement operation - roles not specified in the request will be removed.
    Use this endpoint when you want to synchronize API key roles with an external system, reset a key's roles to a known state, or apply a standardized role template to a key.
    Role assignments take effect immediately for new verifications, though existing authorized sessions may continue until their cache expires.
