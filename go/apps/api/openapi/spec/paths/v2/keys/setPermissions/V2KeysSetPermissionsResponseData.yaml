  Complete list of all permissions now directly assigned to the key after the set operation has completed.

  The response includes:
  - The comprehensive, updated set of direct permissions (reflecting the complete replacement)
  - Both ID and name for each permission for easy reference
  - Permissions sorted alphabetically by name for consistent response format

  Important notes:
  - This only shows direct permissions, not those granted through roles
  - An empty array means the key has no direct permissions assigned
  - For a complete permission picture including roles, use keys.getKey instead
  - All permission changes are logged in the audit log for security tracking
