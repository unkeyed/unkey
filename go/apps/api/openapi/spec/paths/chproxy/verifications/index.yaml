  summary: Internal ClickHouse proxy for verification events
  description: |-
    Internal endpoint for batching key verification events to ClickHouse. This endpoint is used internally by the API to efficiently store verification data and should not be used by external clients.

    This endpoint bypasses normal authentication and validation as it's intended for internal use only. External clients should use the standard key verification endpoints instead.

    required: true
