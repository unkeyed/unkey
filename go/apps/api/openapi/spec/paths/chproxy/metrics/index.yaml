  summary: Internal ClickHouse proxy for API request metrics
  description: |-
    Internal endpoint for batching API request metric events to ClickHouse. This endpoint is used internally by the API to efficiently store request/response data for analytics and should not be used by external clients.

    This endpoint bypasses normal authentication and validation as it's intended for internal use only.
