  summary: Internal ClickHouse proxy for ratelimit events
  description: |-
    Internal endpoint for batching ratelimit events to ClickHouse. This endpoint is used internally by the API to efficiently store ratelimit data and should not be used by external clients.

    This endpoint bypasses normal authentication and validation as it's intended for internal use only.
