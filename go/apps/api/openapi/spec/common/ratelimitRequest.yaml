    description: |-
      The name of this rate limit. This name is used to identify which limit to check during key verification.

      Best practices for limit names:
      - Use descriptive, semantic names like 'api_requests', 'heavy_operations', or 'downloads'
      - Be consistent with naming conventions across your application
      - Create separate limits for different resource types or operation costs
      - Consider using namespaced names for better organization (e.g., 'files.downloads', 'compute.training')

      You will reference this exact name when verifying keys to check against this specific limit.

  limit:
    description: |-
      The maximum number of operations allowed within the specified time window.

      When this limit is reached, verification requests will fail with `code=RATE_LIMITED` until the window resets. The limit should reflect:
      - Your infrastructure capacity and scaling limitations
      - Fair usage expectations for your service
      - Different tier levels for various user types
      - The relative cost of the operations being limited

      Higher values allow more frequent access but may impact service performance.

  duration:

      The duration for each ratelimit window in milliseconds.

      This controls how long the rate limit counter accumulates before resetting. Common values include:
      - 1000 (1 second): For strict per-second limits on high-frequency operations
      - 60000 (1 minute): For moderate API usage control
      - 3600000 (1 hour): For less frequent but costly operations
      - 86400000 (24 hours): For daily quotas

      Shorter windows provide more frequent resets but may allow large burst usage. Longer windows provide more consistent usage patterns but take longer to reset after limit exhaustion.
