# Example Sentinel resource specification
#
# This file demonstrates how to create a Sentinel custom resource
# for monitoring and routing capabilities. The sentinel runs alongside
# application deployments to provide observability and traffic management.
#
# Key configuration elements:
# - Container image and resource allocation
# - Multi-tenant identification (workspace, project, environment)
# - Replica count for high availability
# - CPU and memory limits for performance control

kind: Sentinel
metadata:
  # Unique identifier for this sentinel instance
  name: s-123
  # Target namespace for deployment

spec:
  # Container image to run (should include registry and tag)
  image: nginx:latest
  # Number of replica pods for high availability
  replicas: 3
  # CPU allocation per pod (256 millicores = 0.256 CPU cores)
  cpuMillicores: 256
  # Memory allocation per pod (256 MiB = 256 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
