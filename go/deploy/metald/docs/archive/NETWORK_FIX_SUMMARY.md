# Network Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem Found
When deploying VMs, networking on the host machine would go down due to incorrect veth interface deletion:

1. **Creation**: Veth interfaces were created with names like `vh12345678` and `vn12345678`
2. **Deletion**: Code was trying to delete interfaces named `veth12345678`
3. **Result**: If the host had any interfaces matching the wrong pattern, they could be deleted

## Root Cause
The naming convention mismatch between creation and deletion logic meant metald could accidentally delete unrelated network interfaces on the host system.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Immediate Issue
Updated the veth deletion logic to use the correct naming pattern (`vh-` prefix instead of `veth`).

### 2. Implemented Proper ID Generation
Created a unified naming system with internal ID generation:

- **New ID Generator**: Generates unique 8-character hex IDs
- **Consistent Naming**: All network devices for a VM use the same internal ID
- **Pattern**: 
  ```
  Network ID: a1b2c3d4
  ├── Namespace: ns_vm_a1b2c3d4
  ├── TAP:       tap_a1b2c3d4    (12 chars)
  ├── Veth Host: vh_a1b2c3d4     (10 chars)
  └── Veth NS:   vn_a1b2c3d4     (10 chars)
  ```
  
  Note: Using underscores for better double-click selection in terminals!

### 3. Benefits
- **No Collisions**: Internal IDs ensure uniqueness regardless of client-provided VM IDs
- **Consistent Cleanup**: Stored network ID ensures correct device deletion
- **Linux Compliant**: All names stay within 15-character limit
- **Debuggable**: Clear naming pattern makes troubleshooting easier

## Files Changed
- `internal/network/implementation.go`: Updated to use ID generator
- `internal/network/types.go`: Added NetworkID field to VMNetwork
- `internal/network/idgen.go`: New ID generation system
- `internal/network/idgen_test.go`: Tests for ID generation

## Testing
- Build successful: `make build`
- Tests passing: `go test ./internal/network/...`

## Next Steps
1. Deploy and test in your environment
2. Monitor that network interfaces are created/deleted correctly
3. Verify host networking remains stable during VM operations
