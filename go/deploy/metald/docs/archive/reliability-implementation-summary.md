# Metald Reliability Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive reliability improvement system that addresses all critical gaps in metald's VM process management. This system will significantly improve the reliability of customer workloads.

## 📦 Components Delivered

### 1. VM Health Checking System (`internal/health/vm_health.go`)
**Purpose**: Proactive detection of unhealthy VMs
- ✅ **Configurable health checks** (socket connectivity, process health, API responsiveness)
- ✅ **Real-time monitoring** with 30-second default intervals  
- ✅ **Failure thresholds** to prevent false positives
- ✅ **OpenTelemetry metrics** for observability
- ✅ **Callback system** for state change notifications

**Key Metrics**:
- `unkey_metald_vm_health_checks_total` - Total health checks performed
- `unkey_metald_vm_health_check_failures_total` - Failed health checks
- `unkey_metald_vm_health_check_duration_seconds` - Health check latency

### 2. Orphaned VM Detection & Recovery (`internal/recovery/vm_recovery.go`)
**Purpose**: Automatic detection and recovery of orphaned VMs
- ✅ **Orphan detection** via multiple mechanisms (process death, socket failure, health check failure)
- ✅ **Automatic recovery** with exponential backoff and retry limits
- ✅ **Process recreation** and VM state restoration
- ✅ **Recovery metrics** for operational visibility
- ✅ **Manual recovery triggers** for operational intervention

**Key Metrics**:
- `unkey_metald_vm_orphaned_total` - Orphaned VMs detected by reason
- `unkey_metald_vm_recovery_attempts_total` - Recovery attempts and outcomes
- `unkey_metald_vm_recovery_success_total` - Successful recoveries
- `unkey_metald_vm_recovery_duration_seconds` - Recovery time

### 3. Reliability Integration Layer (`internal/reliability/integration.go`)
**Purpose**: Seamless integration with existing VM management
- ✅ **Registry adapter** for VM state tracking
- ✅ **Process manager adapter** for process lifecycle management
- ✅ **Event-driven architecture** (OnVMCreated, OnVMStarted, etc.)
- ✅ **Configurable reliability subsystem** with feature flags
- ✅ **Backwards compatibility** with existing codebase

### 4. Operational Monitoring via Structured Logging
**Purpose**: Operational visibility through existing log infrastructure
- ✅ **Structured logging** with searchable fields (vm_id, reason, attempt, etc.)
- ✅ **Rich context** in all log messages for troubleshooting
- ✅ **Existing tooling** works (journalctl, log aggregation)
- ✅ **No additional attack surface** or maintenance burden

### 5. Comprehensive Testing (`internal/reliability/integration_test.go`)
**Purpose**: Validation and regression prevention
- ✅ **Unit tests** for all major components
- ✅ **Integration tests** for end-to-end workflows
- ✅ **Mock implementations** for testing isolation
- ✅ **Edge case coverage** (disabled subsystem, missing VMs, etc.)

## 🔧 Integration Points

### To integrate with existing ManagedClient:

```go
// In managed_client.go - add reliability manager
type ManagedClient struct {
    // ... existing fields
    reliabilityManager *reliability.ReliabilityManager
}

// Initialize reliability in NewManagedClient
reliabilityManager, err := reliability.NewReliabilityManager(logger, reliabilityConfig, processManager)
// Set up and start

// Add hooks to existing VM operations:
func (mc *ManagedClient) CreateVM(ctx context.Context, config *metaldv1.VmConfig) (string, error) {
    // ... existing code
    mc.reliabilityManager.OnVMCreated(vmID, processID, config)
    return vmID, nil
}

func (mc *ManagedClient) DeleteVM(ctx context.Context, vmID string) error {
    // ... existing code  
    mc.reliabilityManager.OnVMDeleted(vmID)
    return nil
}
```

### Configuration Example:

```go
reliabilityConfig := &reliability.ReliabilityConfig{
    Enabled: true,
    HealthCheck: &health.HealthCheckConfig{
        Interval:          30 * time.Second,
        Timeout:           5 * time.Second,
        FailureThreshold:  3,
        RecoveryThreshold: 2,
        Enabled:           true,
    },
    Recovery: &recovery.RecoveryConfig{
        MaxRetries:        3,
        RetryInterval:     30 * time.Second,
        BackoffFactor:     2.0,
        MaxRetryInterval:  5 * time.Minute,
        RecoveryTimeout:   10 * time.Minute,
        DetectionInterval: 60 * time.Second,
        Enabled:           true,
    },
}
```

## 📊 Monitoring Integration

### Grafana Dashboard Updates

The existing Grafana dashboards in `grafana-dashboards/` should be updated to include reliability metrics:

**New Panels to Add**:
1. **VM Health Status** - Healthy vs Unhealthy VMs over time
2. **Orphaned VM Count** - Number of orphaned VMs detected
3. **Recovery Success Rate** - Percentage of successful recoveries
4. **Recovery Duration** - Time to recover orphaned VMs
5. **Health Check Failures** - Failed health checks by reason

**Alert Rules**:
- VM orphaned for >5 minutes
- Recovery failure rate >10%
- Health check failure rate >5%
- No successful health checks in 10 minutes

### Operational Monitoring via Logs

**Key Log Queries**:
```bash
# Current orphaned VMs
journalctl -u metald --since "10 minutes ago" | grep "orphaned vm detected"

# Recovery success/failure rates
journalctl -u metald --since "1 hour ago" | grep -c "vm recovery.*successful"
journalctl -u metald --since "1 hour ago" | grep -c "vm recovery.*failed"

# Health check patterns  
journalctl -u metald --since "5 minutes ago" | grep "vm health check failed" | wc -l

# VM-specific issues
journalctl -u metald | grep "vm_id=vm-123" | tail -20
```

### Updated Prometheus Queries:

```promql
# Orphaned VMs
unkey_metald_vm_orphaned_total

# Recovery success rate
rate(unkey_metald_vm_recovery_success_total[5m]) / rate(unkey_metald_vm_recovery_attempts_total[5m]) * 100

# Health check failure rate  
rate(unkey_metald_vm_health_check_failures_total[5m]) / rate(unkey_metald_vm_health_checks_total[5m]) * 100

# VM health status
unkey_metald_reliability_healthy_vms_total
unkey_metald_reliability_unhealthy_vms_total
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Validation Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
go test ./internal/reliability/... -v

# Monitor reliability via logs
journalctl -u metald -f | grep -E "(orphaned|recovery|health_check)"

# Check for orphaned VMs
journalctl -u metald | grep "orphaned vm detected"

journalctl -u metald | grep "vm_id=vm-123" | grep recovery
```

### Chaos Testing Scenarios
1. **Random process kills** - Validate automatic recovery
2. **Socket corruption** - Test orphan detection
3. **Resource exhaustion** - Verify graceful degradation
4. **Network partitions** - Test timeout handling
