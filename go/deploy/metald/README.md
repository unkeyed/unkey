# Metald - VM Lifecycle Management Service

High-performance VM lifecycle management with integrated security isolation and real-time billing.

## Overview

Metald is the central control plane for virtual machine lifecycle management in the Unkey Deploy platform. It provides a unified API for creating, managing, and monitoring microVMs using Firecracker.

**Key Features:**
- **Integrated jailer** for security isolation (no external jailer binary needed)
- **Real-time billing** integration with 100ms precision  
- **Dual-stack networking** with IPv4/IPv6 support and multi-tenant isolation
- **Asset management** integration for dynamic VM image distribution
- **Production-ready** with comprehensive observability and monitoring

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build from source
make build

# Install with systemd
sudo make install

# Run development server
export UNKEY_METALD_BILLING_MOCK_MODE=true
export UNKEY_METALD_ASSETMANAGER_ENABLED=false
./build/metald
```

### Create Your First VM

```bash
# Using the example client
cd contrib/example-client
go run main.go -action create-and-boot

# Or via direct API call
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/vmprovisioner.v1.VmService/CreateVm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev_customer_test123" \
  -d '{
    "config": {
      "cpu": {"vcpu_count": 2},
      "memory": {"size_bytes": 1073741824},
      "boot": {
        "kernel_path": "/opt/vm-assets/vmlinux",
        "kernel_args": "console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1"
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Service Dependencies

Metald integrates with other Unkey Deploy services:
- **[assetmanagerd](../assetmanagerd/docs/README.md)** - VM asset preparation and distribution
- **[billaged](../billaged/docs/README.md)** - Usage tracking and billing
- **builderd** - Indirect integration through assetmanagerd

## Requirements

- Linux with KVM support
- Firecracker binary installed
- Go 1.24+ (for building)
- systemd (for production deployment)

## Security

Metald uses an integrated jailer approach with specific capabilities:
- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` - Namespace operations
- `CAP_NET_ADMIN` - Network device creation  
- `CAP_SYS_CHROOT` - Jail creation
- Additional capabilities for privilege dropping

The `make install` command configures these automatically.
