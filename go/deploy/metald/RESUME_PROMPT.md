# Documentation Reorganization Resume Prompt

## Context

You are continuing a comprehensive documentation reorganization project for the metald VM management platform. The user is an engineer/CTO who requested a complete restructuring of documentation to be:

- **Consolidated**: Remove overlapping/duplicate content
- **Engineer-focused**: Target audience is other engineers/CTO
- **Comprehensive**: Reference + operational procedures focus
- **Component-focused**: Multiple focused architecture docs
- **Visual**: Include Mermaid diagrams for flows and architecture

## System Overview

The metald platform consists of 4 core components:
1. **Gateway** - API gateway and authentication (not yet implemented)
2. **Metald** - VM lifecycle management core (implemented)
3. **Billing** - Real-time metrics collection with 100ms precision (implemented)
4. **ClickHouse** - Analytics database for billing data (planned)

## Work Completed âœ…

### High Priority Tasks (COMPLETED)
1. **âœ… New Documentation Structure** - Created organized folder hierarchy
2. **âœ… System Architecture Overview** - Comprehensive overview with Mermaid diagrams
3. **âœ… Component Architecture Documents** - All 4 components documented:
   - `docs/architecture/components/metald.md` - VM management core
   - `docs/architecture/components/gateway.md` - API gateway design  
   - `docs/architecture/components/billing.md` - Real-time billing system
   - `docs/architecture/components/clickhouse.md` - Analytics database
4. **âœ… IPv6 Networking Consolidation** - Single comprehensive IPv6 guide:
   - `docs/architecture/networking/ipv6.md` - Consolidated from 4 overlapping docs

### Documentation Structure Created

```

## Remaining Work ðŸ”„

### Priority Tasks (from todo list):
1. **ðŸ“‹ Consolidate billing documentation** - Archive/consolidate existing billing docs into architecture + operations
2. **ðŸ“‹ Consolidate reliability documentation** - Merge 3 reliability docs into focused operational guide  
3. **ðŸ“‹ Create operational procedures and runbooks** - Day-to-day operations, incident response, maintenance
4. **ðŸ“‹ Add cross-references and navigation** - Internal links between all documents

### Existing Files to Consolidate:

**Billing Documentation (4 files to consolidate)**:
- `docs/billing-implementation-guide.md` - COMPLETED âœ… implementation 
- `docs/billing-integration-flows.md` - Integration with billaged service
- `docs/billing-metrics-architecture.md` - 100ms precision architecture
- `docs/billing-service-bootstrap-prompt.md` - Bootstrap instructions

**Reliability Documentation (3 files to consolidate)**:
- `docs/reliability-implementation-summary.md` - COMPLETED âœ… implementation
- `docs/reliability-improvement-plan.md` - Original detailed plan
- `docs/simplified-reliability-approach.md` - Streamlined approach

**Other Documentation**:
- `docs/api-reference.md` - Move to `api/reference.md`
- `docs/vm-configuration.md` - Move to `api/configuration.md`
- `docs/backend-support.md` - Already covered in component docs
- `docs/observability.md` - Move to `deployment/monitoring-setup.md`
- `docs/glossary.md` - Move to `reference/glossary.md`
- `docs/stress-test-authentication.md` - Move to `development/testing/stress-testing.md`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Medium Priority)
1. **Consolidate Billing Documentation**:
   - Extract unique content from 4 billing docs
   - Architecture content already in `components/billing.md`
   - Create operational billing guide in `operations/`
   - Archive/remove original files

2. **Consolidate Reliability Documentation**:
   - Merge 3 reliability docs into `operations/reliability.md`
   - Focus on operational procedures vs implementation
   - Include health monitoring, recovery procedures

3. **Create Operational Runbooks**:
   - `operations/runbooks/common-procedures.md` - Daily operations
   - `operations/runbooks/incident-response.md` - Emergency procedures  
   - `operations/runbooks/maintenance.md` - Planned maintenance

4. **Add Cross-References**:
   - Update all documents with internal links
   - Ensure bidirectional references
   - Update navigation in README.md

### Secondary Tasks
5. Move remaining docs to new structure
6. Update README.md with final navigation
7. Archive/remove original files
8. Create reference materials (error codes, metrics)

## Key Principles to Maintain

- **Engineer/CTO Focus**: Comprehensive reference + operational procedures
- **Consolidation**: Remove duplicates, merge overlapping content
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Include flow charts and architecture diagrams
- **Cross-References**: Link related documents bidirectionally
- **Practical Examples**: Include real configuration examples and commands
- **Production Ready**: Focus on operational aspects and troubleshooting

## Commands to Resume

```bash
# Check current documentation structure
ls -la docs/

# Review remaining todo items
cat RESUME_PROMPT.md

# Continue with next highest priority task:
# 1. Consolidate billing documentation
# 2. Consolidate reliability documentation  
# 3. Create operational runbooks
# 4. Add cross-references
```

## Previous Context

The user expressed satisfaction with:
- **System architecture overview** with comprehensive Mermaid diagrams
- **Component-focused architecture docs** with technical depth
- **IPv6 consolidation** eliminating redundancy while preserving all technical information
- **Engineer-focused approach** with operational procedures emphasis

The user wants to **continue exactly where we left off** without asking additional questions. Pick up with the next highest priority task from the todo list.
