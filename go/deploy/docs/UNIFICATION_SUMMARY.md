# Service Unification Summary

## Overview

All four pillar services (assetmanagerd, billaged, builderd, metald) have been unified with consistent Makefile structures, environment examples, and TODO tracking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Unified Makefile Structure

All services now follow the same Makefile template with these standard sections:
- Build & Install
- Code Generation
- Development  
- Testing & Quality
- Service Management
- Utilities
- Service-Specific Targets

Common targets across all services:
- `help` - Show help with automatic target discovery
- `all` - Clean, generate, and build
- `build` - Build with version info in LDFLAGS
- `install/uninstall` - Service installation
- `generate` - Protobuf generation using buf
- `dev` - Development mode
- `test/test-coverage` - Testing targets
- `lint/lint-proto/fmt/vet/check` - Code quality (includes buf lint)
- `service-*` - Service management
- `version` - Show version info
- `env-example` - Display environment variables

### 2. Version Embedding

All services now embed version information via LDFLAGS:
```makefile
LDFLAGS := -ldflags "-X main.version=$(VERSION) -X main.commit=$(COMMIT) -X main.buildTime=$(BUILD_TIME)"
```

### 3. Environment Examples

Created `.env.example` files for all services with:
- Service configuration (port, address, log level)
- TLS/SPIFFE settings
- OpenTelemetry configuration
- Service-specific settings

### 4. TODO Tracking

Added `TODO.md` files for each service to track:
- High priority items
- Medium priority enhancements
- Low priority features
- Completed work

### 5. Removed Targets

As requested, removed:
- `demo`, `quick-demo`, `stats` from billaged
- `stress-test`, `o11y*`, `prod-install` from metald

### 6. Service-Specific Targets Preserved

- **assetmanagerd**: `run-local`
- **billaged**: `health`
- **builderd**: `docker-*`, `example-build`
- **metald**: `env-edit`, `env-show`, `install-sudo`, `vm-test`, `multi-vm-demo`

## Next Steps

1. **Packaging Infrastructure**: Add debian/ and .spec files to assetmanagerd (tracked in TODO.md)
2. **Grafana Dashboards**: Create monitoring dashboards for assetmanagerd (tracked in TODO.md)
3. **Testing**: Ensure all `make test` targets work correctly
4. **Documentation**: Update service README files to reference the unified commands

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Same commands work across all services
- **Discoverability**: `make help` shows all available targets
- **Maintainability**: Changes to common functionality can be applied uniformly
- **Onboarding**: New developers can work with any service using the same patterns
- **Quality**: Integrated protobuf linting with `buf lint` ensures consistent proto style
- **Workflow**: `make check` runs comprehensive checks including protobuf validation
