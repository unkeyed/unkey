        description: List of individual validation errors that occurred in the
          request. Each error provides specific details about what failed validation,
          where the error occurred in the request, and suggestions for fixing
          it. This granular information helps developers quickly identify and
          resolve multiple issues in a single request without having to make repeated
          API calls.

          This provides a direct link to the expected request body schema, enabling
          automated tools and agents to fetch the schema and understand the exact
          structure required. The URL uses a JSON Pointer fragment to reference
          the specific schema within the OpenAPI specification.

description: Extended error details specifically for bad request (400) errors.
  This builds on the BaseError structure by adding an array of individual validation
  errors, making it easy to identify and fix multiple issues at once.
