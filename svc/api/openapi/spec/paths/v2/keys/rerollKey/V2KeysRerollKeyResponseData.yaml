  keyId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The unique identifier for the newly created key.

      This is NOT the actual API key token, but a reference ID for management operations.
      Store this ID to:
      - Update or revoke the key later
      - Track the key in your database
      - Display in admin dashboards (safe to log)

      Note: This is a new ID - the original key retains its own ID.
    example: key_2cGKbMxRyIzhCxo1Idjz8q
  key:
    type: string
    description: |
      The newly generated API key token (the actual secret that authenticates requests).

      **SECURITY CRITICAL:**
      - This is the only time you'll receive the complete key
      - Unkey stores only a hashed version (unless the original key was created with `recoverable=true`)
      - Never log, store, or expose this value in your systems
      - Transmit directly to the end user via secure channels only
      - If lost and not recoverable, you must reroll or create a new key

      The key format follows: `[prefix]_[random_bytes]`
      - Prefix is extracted from the original key or uses API default
      - Random bytes follow API configuration (default: 16 bytes)

      This is NOT the keyId - it's the actual secret token used for authentication.
    example: prod_2cGKbMxRjIzhCxo1IdjH3arELti7Sdyc8w6XYbvtcyuBowPT
