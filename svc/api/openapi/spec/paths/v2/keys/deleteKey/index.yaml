  summary: Delete API keys
  description: |
    Delete API keys permanently from user accounts or for cleanup purposes.

    Use this for user-requested key deletion, account deletion workflows, or cleaning up unused keys. Keys are immediately invalidated. Two modes: soft delete (default, preserves audit records) and permanent delete.

    **Important**: For temporary access control, use `updateKey` with `enabled: false` instead of deletion.

    **Required Permissions**

    Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
    - `api.*.delete_key` (to delete keys in any API)
    - `api.<api_id>.delete_key` (to delete keys in a specific API)
  operationId: keys.deleteKey
