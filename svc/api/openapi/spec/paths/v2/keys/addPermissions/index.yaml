  summary: Add key permissions
  description: |
    Add permissions to a key without affecting existing permissions.

    Use this for privilege upgrades, enabling new features, or plan changes that grant additional capabilities. Permissions granted through roles remain unchanged.

    **Important**: Changes take effect immediately with up to 30-second edge propagation.

    **Required Permissions**

    Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
    - `api.*.update_key` (to update keys in any API)
    - `api.<api_id>.update_key` (to update keys in a specific API)

    **Side Effects**

    Invalidates the key cache for immediate effect, and makes permissions available for verification within 30 seconds across all regions.
