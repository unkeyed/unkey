properties:
  valid:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The primary verification result. If true, the key is valid
      and can be used. If false, check the 'code' field to understand why verification
      failed. Your application should always check this field first before proceeding.
  code:
    type: string
    enum:
      - VALID
      - NOT_FOUND
      - FORBIDDEN
      - INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS
      - USAGE_EXCEEDED
      - RATE_LIMITED
      - DISABLED
      - EXPIRED
    description: |
      A machine-readable code indicating the verification status
      or failure reason. Values: `VALID` (key is valid and passed all checks), `NOT_FOUND` (key doesn't
      exist or belongs to wrong API), `FORBIDDEN` (key lacks required permissions), `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS`
      (key lacks specific required permissions for this request), `USAGE_EXCEEDED` (key has no remaining credits), `RATE_LIMITED` (key exceeded rate limits), `DISABLED` (key was explicitly disabled),
      `EXPIRED` (key has passed its expiration date).
  keyId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The unique identifier of the verified key in Unkey's system.
      Use this ID for operations like updating or revoking the key. This field
      is returned for both valid and invalid keys (except when `code=NOT_FOUND`).
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer: true
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer-with-omitzero: true
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The human-readable name assigned to this key during creation.
      This is useful for displaying in logs or admin interfaces to identify
      the key's purpose.

  meta:
    type: object
    additionalProperties: true
    description: |
      Custom metadata associated with the key. This can include any
      JSON-serializable data you stored with the key during creation or updates,
      such as plan information, feature flags, or user details. Use this to
      avoid additional database lookups for contextual information needed during
      API calls.
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer: true
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer-with-omitzero: true
  expires:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    description: |
      Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) when the key will expire.
      If omitted, the key has no expiration. You can use this to
      warn users about upcoming expirations or to understand the validity period.
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer: true
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer-with-omitzero: true
  credits:
    type: integer
    format: int32
    description: |
      The number of requests/credits remaining for this key. If omitted,
      the key has unlimited usage. This value decreases with
      each verification (based on the 'cost' parameter) unless explicit credit
      refills are configured.
  enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates if the key is currently enabled. Disabled keys will
      always fail verification with `code=DISABLED`. This is useful for implementing
      temporary suspensions without deleting the key.
  permissions:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      A list of all permission names assigned to this key, either
      directly or through roles. These permissions determine what actions the
      key can perform. Only returned when permissions were checked during verification
      or when the key fails with `code=FORBIDDEN`.
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer: true
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer-with-omitzero: true
  roles:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      A list of all role names assigned to this key. Roles are collections
      of permissions that grant access to specific functionality. Only returned
      when permissions were checked during verification.
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer: true
    x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer-with-omitzero: true
  identity:
    "$ref": "../../../../common/Identity.yaml"
    description: |
      Information about the identity associated with this key. Identities
      allow multiple keys to share resources (like rate limits) and represent
      the same user or entity across different applications or devices.
