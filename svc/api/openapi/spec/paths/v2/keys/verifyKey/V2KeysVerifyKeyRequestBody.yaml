      The API key to verify, exactly as provided by your user.
      Include any prefix - even small changes will cause verification to fail.
    example: sk_1234abcdef

      Attaches metadata tags for analytics and monitoring without affecting verification outcomes.
      Enables segmentation of API usage in dashboards by endpoint, client version, region, or custom dimensions.
      Use 'key=value' format for compatibility with most analytics tools and clear categorization.
      Avoid including sensitive data in tags as they may appear in logs and analytics reports.
    example:
      - endpoint=/users/profile
      - method=GET
      - region=us-east-1
      - clientVersion=2.3.0
      - feature=premium
  permissions:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    maxLength: 1000
    description: |
      Checks if the key has the specified permission(s) using a query syntax.
      Supports single permissions, logical operators (AND, OR), and parentheses for grouping.
      Examples:
      - Single permission: "documents.read"
      - Multiple permissions: "documents.read AND documents.write"
      - Complex queries: "(documents.read OR documents.write) AND users.view"
      Verification fails if the key lacks the required permissions through direct assignment or role inheritance.
    example: "documents.read AND users.view"

    description: |
      Enforces time-based rate limiting during verification to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
      Omitting this field skips rate limit checks entirely, relying only on configured key rate limits.
      Multiple rate limits can be checked simultaneously, each with different costs and temporary overrides.
      Rate limit checks are optimized for performance but may allow brief bursts during high concurrency.
