      The API namespace this key belongs to.
      Keys from different APIs cannot access each other.
    example: api_1234abcd
  prefix:

    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"
    description: |
      Adds a visual identifier to the beginning of the generated key for easier recognition in logs and dashboards.
      The prefix becomes part of the actual key string (e.g., `prod_xxxxxxxxx`).
      Avoid using sensitive information in prefixes as they may appear in logs and error messages.
    example: prod
  name:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    maxLength: 255
    description: |
      Sets a human-readable identifier for internal organization and dashboard display.
      Never exposed to end users, only visible in management interfaces and API responses.
      Avoid generic names like "API Key" when managing multiple keys for the same user or service.
    example: Payment Service Production Key
  byteLength:
    type: integer
    minimum: 16  # Minimum secure key length
    maximum: 255  # Reasonable upper bound for key generation
    default: 16
    description: |
      Controls the cryptographic strength of the generated key in bytes.
      Higher values increase security but result in longer keys that may be more annoying to handle.
      The default 16 bytes provides 2^128 possible combinations, sufficient for most applications.
      Consider 32 bytes for highly sensitive APIs, but avoid values above 64 bytes unless specifically required.
    example: 24
  externalId:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    maxLength: 255  # Match database varchar limits for external identifiers

      Links this key to a user or entity in your system using your own identifier.
      Returned during verification to identify the key owner without additional database lookups.
      Essential for user-specific analytics, billing, and multi-tenant key management.
      Use your primary user ID, organization ID, or tenant ID for best results.
      Accepts letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens for flexible identifier formats.
    example: user_1234abcd

    description: |
      Stores arbitrary JSON metadata returned during key verification for contextual information.
      Eliminates additional database lookups during verification, improving performance for stateless services.
      Avoid storing sensitive data here as it's returned in verification responses.
      Large metadata objects increase verification latency and should stay under 10KB total size.
    example:
      plan: enterprise
      featureFlags:
        betaAccess: true
        concurrentConnections: 10
      customerName: Acme Corp
      billing:
        tier: premium
        renewal: "2024-12-31"
  roles:
    type: array
    maxItems: 100  # Reasonable limit for role assignments per key
    items:
      type: string
      minLength: 1
      maxLength: 100  # Keep role names concise and readable
      pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_:\-\.\*]+$
    description: |
      Assigns existing roles to this key for permission management through role-based access control.
      Roles must already exist in your workspace before assignment.
      During verification, all permissions from assigned roles are checked against requested permissions.
      Roles provide a convenient way to group permissions and apply consistent access patterns across multiple keys.
    example:
      - api_admin
      - billing_reader
  permissions:
    type: array
    maxItems: 1000  # Allow extensive permission sets for complex applications
    items:
      type: string
      minLength: 1
      maxLength: 100  # Keep permission names concise and readable
    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9._-]*$"
    description: |
      Grants specific permissions directly to this key without requiring role membership.
      Wildcard permissions like `documents.*` grant access to all sub-permissions including `documents.read` and `documents.write`.
      Direct permissions supplement any permissions inherited from assigned roles.
    example:
      - documents.read
      - documents.write
      - settings.view
  expires:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 4102444800000  # January 1, 2100 - reasonable future limit
    description: |
      Sets when this key automatically expires as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.
      Verification fails with code=EXPIRED immediately after this time passes.
      Omitting this field creates a permanent key that never expires.

      Avoid setting timestamps in the past as they immediately invalidate the key.
      Keys expire based on server time, not client time, which prevents timezone-related issues.
      Essential for trial periods, temporary access, and security compliance requiring key rotation.
    example: 1704067200000

      Controls usage-based limits through credit consumption with optional automatic refills.
      Unlike rate limits which control frequency, credits control total usage with global consistency.
      Essential for implementing usage-based pricing, subscription tiers, and hard usage quotas.
      Omitting this field creates unlimited usage, while setting null is not allowed during creation.
  ratelimits:
    type: array
    maxItems: 50  # Reasonable limit for rate limit configurations per identity
    items:
      "$ref": "../../../../common/RatelimitRequest.yaml"
    description: |
      Defines time-based rate limits that protect against abuse by controlling request frequency.
      Unlike credits which track total usage, rate limits reset automatically after each window expires.
      Multiple rate limits can control different operation types with separate thresholds and windows.
      Essential for preventing API abuse while maintaining good performance for legitimate usage.
    example:
      - name: requests
        limit: 100
        duration: 60000
        autoApply: true
      - name: heavy_operations
        limit: 10
        duration: 3600000
        autoApply: false
  enabled:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: |
      Controls whether the key is active immediately upon creation.
      When set to `false`, the key exists but all verification attempts fail with `code=DISABLED`.
      Useful for pre-creating keys that will be activated later or for keys requiring manual approval.
      Most keys should be created with `enabled=true` for immediate use.
    example: true
  recoverable:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Controls whether the plaintext key is stored in an encrypted vault for later retrieval.
      When true, allows recovering the actual key value using keys.getKey with decrypt=true.
      When false, the key value cannot be retrieved after creation for maximum security.
      Only enable for development keys or when key recovery is absolutely necessary.
