  summary: Update key settings
  description: |
    Update key properties in response to plan changes, subscription updates, or account status changes.

    Use this for user upgrades/downgrades, role modifications, or administrative changes. Supports partial updates - only specify fields you want to change. Set fields to null to clear them.

    **Important**: Permissions and roles are replaced entirely. Use dedicated add/remove endpoints for incremental changes.

    **Required Permissions**

    Your root key must have one of the following permissions:
    - `api.*.update_key` (to update keys in any API)
    - `api.<api_id>.update_key` (to update keys in a specific API)

    **Side Effects**

    If you specify an `externalId` that doesn't exist, a new identity will be automatically created and linked to the key. Permission updates will auto-create any permissions that don't exist in your workspace. Changes take effect immediately but may take up to 30 seconds to propagate to all edge regions due to cache invalidation.
