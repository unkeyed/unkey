            Specifies which key to update using the database identifier returned from `createKey`.
            Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.

            Sets a human-readable name for internal organization and identification.
            Omitting this field leaves the current name unchanged, while setting null removes it entirely.
            Avoid generic names like "API Key" when managing multiple keys per user or service.
        example: Payment Service Production Key

            Links this key to a user or entity in your system for ownership tracking during verification.
            Omitting this field preserves the current association, while setting null disconnects the key from any identity.
            Essential for user-specific analytics, billing, and key management across multiple users.
            Supports letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens for flexible identifier formats.

            Stores arbitrary JSON metadata returned during key verification.
            Omitting this field preserves existing metadata, while setting null removes all metadata entirely.
            Avoid storing sensitive data here as it's returned in verification responses.
            Large metadata objects increase verification latency and should stay under 10KB total size.
        example:
            plan: enterprise
            limits:
                storage: 500GB
                compute: 1000 minutes/month

        format: int64

        maximum: 4102444800000 # January 1, 2100 - reasonable future limit
        description: |
            Sets when this key automatically expires as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.
            Verification fails with code=EXPIRED immediately after this time passes.
            Omitting this field preserves the current expiration, while setting null makes the key permanent.

            Avoid setting timestamps in the past as they immediately invalidate the key.
            Keys expire based on server time, not client time, which prevents timezone-related issues.
            Active sessions continue until their next verification attempt after expiry.

        description: |
            Controls usage-based limits for this key through credit consumption.
            Omitting this field preserves current credit settings, while setting null enables unlimited usage.
            Cannot configure refill settings when credits is null, and refillDay requires monthly interval.
            Essential for implementing usage-based pricing and subscription quotas.
    ratelimits:
        type: array
        maxItems: 50 # Reasonable limit for rate limit configurations per key

        description: |
            Defines time-based rate limits that protect against abuse by controlling request frequency.
            Omitting this field preserves existing rate limits, while setting null removes all rate limits.
            Unlike credits which track total usage, rate limits reset automatically after each window expires.
            Multiple rate limits can control different operation types with separate thresholds and windows.

        description: |
            Controls whether the key is currently active for verification requests.
            When set to `false`, all verification attempts fail with `code=DISABLED` regardless of other settings.
            Omitting this field preserves the current enabled status.
            Useful for temporarily suspending access during billing issues, security incidents, or maintenance windows without losing key configuration.
        example: true
    roles:
        type: array
        maxItems: 100 # Reasonable limit for role assignments per key
        items:
            type: string
            minLength: 1
            maxLength: 100 # Keep role names concise and readable

            description: |
                Assigns existing roles to this key for permission management through role-based access control.
                Roles must already exist in your workspace before assignment.
                During verification, all permissions from assigned roles are checked against requested permissions.
                Roles provide a convenient way to group permissions and apply consistent access patterns across multiple keys.
        example:
            - api_admin
            - billing_reader
    permissions:
        type: array
        maxItems: 1000 # Allow extensive permission sets for complex applications
        items:
            type: string
            minLength: 3

                Grants specific permissions directly to this key without requiring role membership.
                Wildcard permissions like `documents.*` grant access to all sub-permissions including `documents.read` and `documents.write`.
                Direct permissions supplement any permissions inherited from assigned roles.
        example:
            - documents.read
            - documents.write
            - settings.view
