  The response includes:
  - The comprehensive, updated set of direct permissions (reflecting the complete replacement)
  - Both ID and name for each permission for easy reference

  Important notes:
  - This only shows direct permissions, not those granted through roles
  - An empty array means the key has no direct permissions assigned
  - For a complete permission picture including roles, use keys.getKey instead
