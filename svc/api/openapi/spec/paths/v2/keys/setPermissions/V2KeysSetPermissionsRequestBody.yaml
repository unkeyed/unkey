      Specifies which key receives the additional permissions using the database identifier returned from `keys.createKey`.
      Do not confuse this with the actual API key string that users include in requests.

      The permissions to set for this key.

      This is a complete replacement operation - it overwrites all existing direct permissions with this new set.

      Key behaviors:
      - Providing an empty array removes all direct permissions from the key
      - This only affects direct permissions - permissions granted through roles are not affected
      - All existing direct permissions not included in this list will be removed

      Any permissions that do not exist will be auto created if the root key has permissions, otherwise this operation will fail with a 403 error.
