      Creates a permission with this human-readable name that describes its purpose.
      Names must be unique within your workspace to prevent conflicts during assignment.
      Use clear, semantic names that developers can easily understand when building authorization logic.
      Consider using hierarchical naming conventions like 'resource.action' for better organization.

      Examples: 'users.read', 'billing.write', 'analytics.view', 'admin.manage'
    example: "users.read"
  slug:
    type: string
    minLength: 1

      Creates a URL-safe identifier for this permission that can be used in APIs and integrations.
      Must start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, periods, underscores, and hyphens.
      Slugs are often used in REST endpoints, configuration files, and external integrations.
      Should closely match the name but in a format suitable for technical usage.
      Must be unique within your workspace to ensure reliable permission lookups.

      Keep slugs concise but descriptive for better developer experience.
    example: "users-read"
