  summary: Invalidate cache entries
  description: |-
    Internal endpoint for invalidating cached entries across all API nodes.
    Used by the dashboard to notify the API after mutations so stale cache
    entries are evicted immediately rather than waiting for TTL expiry.

    Invalidation is propagated to all cluster nodes via gossip when clustering
    is enabled.

    This endpoint requires a dedicated bearer token and should not be used by
    external clients.

    required: true
