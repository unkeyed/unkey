# This GitHub Actions workflow triggers after receiving a Deployment Status event from GH Actions environment. This works
# with providers like Vercel, Heroku and others. This workflow does the following
#
# - Runs after deployment event
# - Uses the environment_url provided in the deployment event
# - Dry run all the checks on Checkly
# - If the dry run passes, deploy the checks.
#
#  You can of course trigger the Checkly CLI in other workflows or steps inside your GH Action configuration.
