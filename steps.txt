OK. I got an error when visiting the semantic cache view locally. Let's see why.

Might help if I start by opening the right web application...

OK working now.

First error: I need clicking deploy to actually create a new llmGateway. 

Alright. I fixed up the tRPC router. Now I need to get the redirects working: right now they aren't.

OK. The redirects were actually working: it's just that gateway creation had another bug. The form was submitting, 
but it wasn't actually creating a gateway yet.

Next up, I should get the analytics chart working. For that, I'll need some actual data to be in Tinybird. 

Easy way to do that is to write a script that writes a bunch of data to it. I will just need to do that once, then 
it will be re-usable.
