# How to use Unkey to set up billing for your AI application

Example of a generative AI application using Unkey for billing.

- Includes example code to set up Stripe for payment links
- On payment, users are assigned an Unkey API key with the 'remaining' field set to 10, signifying 10 credits
- This API key is saved to a cookie (httpOnly, so not accessible via client-side Javascript)
- This cookie is attached to requests to an API route in /api/openai; this API route verifies the key (decrementing `remaining`) and requests images from OpenAI
