# Unkey with Clerk

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have a Clerk and Unkey account, and add them to the `.env` you can see an example in the `.env.example`.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
UNKEY_API_ID=api_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
UNKEY_ROOT_KEY=unkey_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then you can run the server locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
