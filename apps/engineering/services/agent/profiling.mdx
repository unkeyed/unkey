title: Profiling
---


The agent exposes pprof endpoints for profiling. The following endpoints are available and require basic authentication to access them:
- `/debug/pprof/`
- `/debug/pprof/cmdline`
- `/debug/pprof/profile`
- `/debug/pprof/symbol`
- `/debug/pprof/trace`

To enable profiling, set the `pprof` configuration option in the agent configuration file. The agent will then expose the pprof endpoints protected by basic authentication.

```json
{
  "pprof": {
    "username": "PPROF_USERNAME",
    "password": "PPROF_PASSWORD"
  }
}
```

There are some helper scripts available in the agent repository to interact with the pprof endpoints. The scripts are located in the `scripts` directory.

These scripts profile the machine and then open your browser to the pprof web interface. The pprof web interface allows you to analyze the profile data.

## Profiling the cpu
```bash
cd apps/agent
set PPROF_USERNAME=XXX
set PPROF_PASSWORD=XXX 
set MACHINE_ID=XXX 

bash ./scripts/profile.bash
```


## Profiling memory
```bash
cd apps/agent
set PPROF_USERNAME=XXX
set PPROF_PASSWORD=XXX 
set MACHINE_ID=XXX 

bash ./scripts/heap.bash
```
