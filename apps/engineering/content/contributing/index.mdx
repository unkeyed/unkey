Contributions are what makes the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. To ensure the best possible outcome for everyone, please read this guide carefully before starting work.

## Before You Contribute

To make contributing a great experience for everyone and avoid wasted effort, please follow these important steps:

### Public Discussion Required

1. **All contribution discussions MUST happen in public channels:**
   - GitHub Issues/Discussions
   - [Public Discord channels](https://unkey.dev/discord)

2. **Do not send Direct Messages (DMs) to team members about contributions!**
   - DMs will be redirected to public channels
   - This ensures transparency and helps others learn from the discussion

### Getting Started

1. **For Existing Issues:**
   - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
   - Comment on the issue to express your interest
   - Wait for a core team member to assign the issue to you
   - Only begin work after receiving confirmation

2. **For New Ideas:**
   - **Do not start coding immediately**
   - Discuss your idea first in our public channels:
     - Create a GitHub issue
     - Start a discussion in our [Discord](https://unkey.com/discord)
   - Wait for feedback from a core team member
   - Only proceed with development after receiving explicit approval

This process helps ensure your contribution aligns with our roadmap and prevents duplicate or conflicting work.

## House Rules

### Issue and PR Guidelines
- Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in [issues](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/pulls)
- Always create an issue before starting development
- Reference the issue in your PR using `fixes #XXX` or `refs #XXX`

### Approval Process
- All new issues get a `needs-approval` label automatically
- **What Needs Prior Approval:**
  - New features (large or small)
  - Refactoring work
  - Changes to core functionality
  - UI/UX changes
- **What Can Start Immediately:**
  - Bug fixes
  - Security improvements
  - Documentation updates
  - Typo corrections



### Prerequisites

You need the following services to run Unkey:


<Callout>
  We're currently working on making this optional.
</Callout>

You also need the following tools installed.

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)


### Developing Unkey
<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Repository
    Clone the [repo](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey
    ```


  </Step>

  <Step>
   #### Install
    ```bash
    cd unkey
    corepack enable
    pnpm install
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  #### Setup local development
  Unkey provides a CLI to setup our local development environment. Run the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  pnpm local
  ```
  <Callout type="warn">
    Docker must be running for us to spin up the databases and supporting services.
  </Callout>

  You will be prompted to enter the following values:

  - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Your Clerk secret key.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your Clerk public key.



  We will create the required `.env` files depending on the selection you've made.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### About pnpm local command

If you have already set up Unkey locally once and wish to bypass the manual input questions the next time, you can do so by using flags with the pnpm local command.

    ```bash
    pnpm local [options]
    ```

List of available options:

- `--service=<service>`: Specifies which part of the application to develop. The values are `dashboard`, `api`, or `www`

- `--skip-env`: Skips the environment setup prompt if specified.

Example:

    ```bash
    pnpm local --service=dashboard --skip-env
    ```
