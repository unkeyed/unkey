# Repository Version

The main version of the repository is only for the `agent`. Sdks and other libraries have their own independent versioning.

## Releasing packages

All of the npm packages are versioned via changesets. This allows us to have a dedicated version for the agent, while still allowing us to version each package independently.

To release a new version of a package, you need to create a new changeset with your PR. This will trigger a GitHub action that will publish the new version of the package.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create Changeset">
    In your feature branch, create a new changeset with `pnpm changeset`
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create PR">
        Commit the generated changeset alongside your changes.
        Changesets will be generated in the `.changeset` folder in the repository root.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create PR" >
        Create a new PR into `main`.
    </Step>

        *This step happens automatically in the CI*

        Once the PR is approved and merged, we create a new PR automatically in the CI, which consumes the changesets and bumps the versions accordingly.

        Merging the version-bump pr will release all the packages to npm if necessary.
    </Step>
