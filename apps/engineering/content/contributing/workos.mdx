  ### Select Environment

  In the top left corner, select the environment you want to use.
  For Unkey employees, this is `staging`.

<Step>
  ### Copy credentials

  Under the `Quick start` section on [/get-started](https://dashboard.workos.com/get-started), you should find the `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` and `WORKOS_API_KEY`.

  You'll need those in the next step.



</Step>

<Step>
  ### Configure .env

  In `/apps/dashboard/.env`, ensure the following variables are set:

```
AUTH_PROVIDER="workos"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/auth/sso-callback"
WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD=
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=
WORKOS_API_KEY=
```

You can generate a secure cookie password via `openssl rand -base64 64`
