title: Rate Limiting Architecture
---

Rate limiting is a critical component of our infrastructure, ensuring accurate and robust rate limiting for our customers. This document provides an in-depth look at our rate limiting architecture, explaining each component and concept in detail.

## Cluster Formation

### Redis for Initial Discovery:

Redis serves as a temporary storage solution to facilitate the initial discovery of nodes. Each node writes its unique identifier and network address to Redis with a 60-second Time-To-Live (TTL), ensuring information is refreshed and stale data is removed. This allows for quick cluster formation without pre-configuring nodes with peer addresses.

### Memberlist for Cluster Management:

After discovery through Redis, nodes switch to using HashiCorpâ€™s memberlist library, which handles node joining, leaving, and failure detection via a gossip protocol. This protocol allows for decentralized communication and efficient scaling with the number of nodes.

## Load Balancing

Our architecture employs both global and regional load balancers. The global load balancer directs traffic to regional load balancers, which then distribute traffic randomly across nodes within a region. This random distribution requires coordination among nodes to ensure accurate rate limiting.

## Rate Limit Coordination Strategies

### Full Replication:

Every request is replicated to all nodes, providing high accuracy but resulting in high network overhead.

### Limit Exceeded Notification:

Nodes notify others only when a rate limit is exceeded, minimizing communication but reducing accuracy.

### Hybrid Approach:

Origin Node Concept: Consistent hashing determines a specific "origin node" for each client identifier. The origin node acts as the source of truth for rate limiting data.

Nodes cache rate limit data locally and asynchronously update the origin node, reducing latency. When a node detects a limit exceedance, it broadcasts this information to all nodes to prevent further requests.

## Implementation Details

### Consistent Hashing:

Maps each client identifier to a point on a hash ring, with nodes also assigned points. The node closest to the client identifier is the origin node, ensuring even load distribution and minimizing consultation needs.

### Async Updates and Broadcast Mechanism:

Nodes handle requests locally and asynchronously update the origin node, reducing client latency. A broadcast is triggered when the origin node count exceeds a limit, quickly informing all nodes to maintain rate limit integrity.

## Future Considerations

### Global Coordination:

We aim to extend cluster coordination beyond regional boundaries using a global gossip protocol for consistent rate limiting across regions.

### Service Discovery Transition:

We plan to move from Redis to AWS Cloud Map for service discovery, providing a more integrated and scalable solution within AWS infrastructure.

This architecture strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency, offering a robust solution for managing rate limiting across a distributed system.
