title: ClickHouse
---

Unkey generates a lot of usage data, such as API requests, system metrics, verification/ratelimit outcomes and more.
Most of it we serve back to the user through our dashboard or API, but we also use this data internally to drive our billing and alerts.

ClickHouse is a perfect fit for us, for it's very high ingest capabilities and easy of querying through SQL.

We're using [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.com/cloud) offering and run our staging and production clusters in AWS us-east-1.

## Working with ClickHouse

For development, we run ClickHouse inside our docker-compose setup and it will be autostarted and migrated for you.

The [`/internal/clickhouse`](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/tree/main/internal/clickhouse) package contains both the schema as well as a typescript client for inserting and querying.
All queries/inserts must be defined in this package.

For migrations, we're using [goose](https://pressly.github.io/goose). This is only really relevant when migrating the staging and production clusters, as it is taken care of automatically during the docker compose setup.

While ClickHouse can ingest millions of rows per second, it can only achieve this with relatively large insert batches of tens of thousands of rows per request. This presents a challenge in our serverless setup, as most of our API invocations would only insert a single row per table.
That's why we're using a [ClickHouse Proxy](/architecture/services/clickhouse-proxy) for our inserts.



## Core Concepts

### 1. Database Organization

We organize data into logical databases:

- **verifications**: All data related to key verifications
- **ratelimits**: Everything about rate limit events
- **metrics**: API request logs and performance metrics
- **billing**: Aggregated data used for customer billing
- **business**: Analytics for internal business metrics
- **telemetry**: SDK and client usage information

### 2. Table Types

There are three main types of tables you'll encounter:

- **Raw tables**: Capture raw events as they happen (e.g., `raw_key_verifications_v1`)
- **Aggregated tables**: Store pre-computed summaries (e.g., `key_verifications_per_hour_v3`)
- **Materialized views**: Connect raw and aggregated tables, processing data automatically (e.g., `key_verifications_per_hour_mv_v3`)

### 3. Naming Convention

We follow a consistent naming pattern:
- `raw_<domain>_<description>_v<version>` for raw tables
- `<domain>_<description>_per_<time_unit>_v<version>` for aggregated tables
- `<description>_<aggregation>_mv_v<version>` for materialized views

## Key Tables You Should Know About

### For Verification Analytics

- **`verifications.raw_key_verifications_v1`**: Every individual key verification event
- **`verifications.key_verifications_per_hour_v3`**: Hourly summary of verifications
- **`verifications.key_verifications_per_day_v3`**: Daily summary of verifications
- **`verifications.key_verifications_per_month_v3`**: Monthly summary of verifications

### For Rate Limit Analytics

- **`ratelimits.raw_ratelimits_v1`**: Individual rate limit checks
- **`ratelimits.ratelimits_per_hour_v1`**: Hourly summary of rate limits
- **`ratelimits.ratelimits_last_used_v1`**: Tracks when identifiers were last rate limited

### For Billing

- **`billing.billable_verifications_per_month_v2`**: Monthly count of billable verifications
- **`billing.billable_ratelimits_per_month_v1`**: Monthly count of billable rate limits

## How Data Flows

1. **Collection**: When a key is verified or a rate limit is checked, we log an event
2. **Processing**: Materialized views automatically process these events into summaries
3. **Aggregation**: Data is aggregated at different time intervals (hour/day/month)
4. **Querying**: Our API and dashboard query these aggregated tables

## Working with the ClickHouse Client

Our TypeScript client in `@unkey/clickhouse` makes it easy to interact with ClickHouse:

```typescript
// Initialize the client
const ch = new ClickHouse({ url: process.env.CLICKHOUSE_URL });

// Insert verification events
await ch.verifications.insert({
  request_id: "req_123",
  time: Date.now(),
  workspace_id: "ws_123",
  key_space_id: "ks_123",
  key_id: "key_123",
  outcome: "VALID",
  region: "us-east-1",
  tags: ["prod", "api"]
});

// Query verification statistics
const stats = await ch.verifications.perDay({
  workspaceId: "ws_123",
  keySpaceId: "ks_123",
  start: yesterdayTimestamp,
  end: nowTimestamp
});

// Get billable usage for a month
const usage = await ch.billing.billableVerifications({
  workspaceId: "ws_123",
  year: 2023,
  month: 7
});
```

## Common Tasks

### How to track key usage over time

```typescript
const dailyUsage = await ch.verifications.timeseries.perDay({
  workspaceId: "ws_123",
  keyspaceId: "ks_123",
  startTime: startOfMonth.getTime(),
  endTime: endOfMonth.getTime()
});

// dailyUsage will contain points with total verifications and valid verifications
// [{x: timestamp, y: {total: 100, valid: 95}}, ...]
```

### How to see recent key verifications

```typescript
const recentVerifications = await ch.verifications.logs({
  workspaceId: "ws_123",
  keySpaceId: "ks_123",
  keyId: "key_123"
});

// Returns the 50 most recent verifications for this key
```

### How to query rate limit data

```typescript
const ratelimitStats = await ch.ratelimits.timeseries.perHour({
  workspaceId: "ws_123",
  namespaceId: "ns_123",
  startTime: yesterday.getTime(),
  endTime: now.getTime(),
  identifiers: [{operator: "is", value: "user_123"}]
});

// Returns hourly rate limit stats for a specific identifier
```

## Development Tips

1. **Local Setup**: Docker Compose includes a ClickHouse instance that automatically runs migrations
2. **Migrations**: We use `goose` for schema migrations in `/schema` directory
3. **Testing**: Use `vitest` to test your ClickHouse queries with `ClickHouseContainer`
4. **Schema Changes**: When changing schema, create a new file in `/schema` with proper versioning

## Debugging Queries

If you need to understand or optimize a query:

1. Use the client's query method directly for custom queries:
   ```typescript
   const result = await ch.querier.query({
     query: `SELECT count() FROM verifications.raw_key_verifications_v1 WHERE workspace_id = {workspaceId: String}`,
     params: z.object({ workspaceId: z.string() }),
     schema: z.object({ count: z.number() })
   })({ workspaceId: "ws_123" });
   ```

2. Check performance with `EXPLAIN`:
   ```typescript
   const explain = await ch.querier.query({
     query: `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM verifications.raw_key_verifications_v1 WHERE workspace_id = {workspaceId: String}`,
     params: z.object({ workspaceId: z.string() }),
     schema: z.object({ explain: z.string() })
   })({ workspaceId: "ws_123" });
   ```
