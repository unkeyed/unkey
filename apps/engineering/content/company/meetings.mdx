Unkey is an async-first company with employees in different timezones. We try to avoid scheduled meetings as much as possible.
That doesn't mean we don't meet at all, but we actively try to reduce the number of meetings and make them as efficient as possible.

Instead of a weekly sync meeting, try to communicate asynchronously in slack and do inpromtu meetings when needed.


<Callout>
  Always question if a meeting is necessary. Can the same information be shared in a document or a slack message? If so, do that instead.

 Fight for your time and the time of others.

## No Standups

We don't do daily or weekly standups. Instead, we do async dailies. This means you write a short update in the #daily-updates channel in slack.
This can be anything from what you did yesterday, what you plan to do today, or if you're blocked on something.

It gives everyone context of what others do and you can easily hook into it by asking questions, or coordinating with the other person.

We also encourage you to put PRs, that need reviews, into the “blocked” section.

## 1:1s

One on one meetings are very personal and should be treated as such. There is no fixed schedule for them, some people do them weekly, some bi-weekly, some monthly.
They range from brainstorming sessions, to personal growth, feedback, and to discuss any issues you might have.

They are not for status updates, we have the daily updates for that.

## Monthly All Hands

Once a month, we have an all hands meeting. It's a palce to realign, celebrate wins and look at what we need to improve.

James leads the meeting with a short update on the company.
Every person or team is encouraged to add a slide to talk about what they feel is most important.


## Request For Comments

Meetings can be great to discuss RFCs in detail and bounce ideas around. Whoever posts an RFC should create a meeting slot roughly a week later, so everyone has time to read it and prepare questions.
Anyone can join, but nobody is obligated to join. If all questions can be solved before the meeting, just cancel it and consider the RFC approved.
