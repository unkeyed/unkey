Machine and human readable error codes

The Unkey API returns machine readable error codes to quickly identify the type of error as well as link to the docs and a requestId. Please always include the requestId in your error report.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "We were unable to authorize your request. Either your key was missing, malformed or does not have the required permissions.",
    "docs": "https://unkey.api/docs/api-reference/errors/code/UNAUTHORIZED",
    "requestId": "req_1234567890"
  }
}
```

If you canâ€™t debug something on your own or think there is a bug, please get in touch with us on Discord or Email and provide the full error response.


## In the future

When we move the API from cloudflare to stateful servers, we will expand upon this 
to offer more error details to the user in a well defined format.


[RFC9457](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457.html) looks interesting.
