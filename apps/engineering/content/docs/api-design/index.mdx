description: How should our API look and feel.
---

Most of our users interact more with our API than with our dashboard. Therefore we need to carefully design the experience they will have.




## Goals for a great developer experience

- must be intuitive and predictable across programming languages.
- must be helpful when things go wrong
- never leave the user alone without a clear action to resolve their issue
- must have excellent documentation.
- must be fast.
