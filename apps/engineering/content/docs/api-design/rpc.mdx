# RPC-Style Approach

We use an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) style API that focuses on *actions* rather than resources. This means endpoints represent specific operations:

```
https://api.unkey.com/v2/{service}.{procedure}
```

For example:
- `POST /v2/keys.createKey` - Create a new API key
- `POST /v2/ratelimit.limit` - Check or enforce a rate limit

We chose this approach because it maps directly to the operations developers want to perform, making the API intuitive to use.

## HTTP Methods

We exclusively use POST for all operations. While this deviates from REST conventions, it provides several advantages:

1. **Consistent Request Pattern**: All requests follow the same pattern regardless of operation
2. **Rich Query Parameters**: Complex filtering and querying without URL length limitations
3. **Security and Compatibility**: Avoids issues with proxies or firewalls logging potentially sensitive parameters in the url


## Request Format

All requests should:
- Use the POST HTTP method
- Include a Content-Type header set to application/json
- Include an Authorization header (see Authentication documentation)
- Send parameters as a JSON object in the request body

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.createKey" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer root_1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "api_1234",
    "name": "Production API Key"
  }'
```

## Service Namespaces

Our API is organized into logical service namespaces that group related procedures:

- **keys** - API key management (create, verify, revoke)
- **apis** - API configuration and settings
- **ratelimit** - Rate limiting services
- **analytics** - Usage and performance data
- **identities** - Identity management
- **permissions** - Permission management

Each namespace contains multiple procedures that perform specific actions within that domain.

## Benefits of RPC Design

We believe our RPC-style approach offers significant benefits:

1. **Clarity of Intent**: Endpoint names clearly communicate the action being performed
2. **Natural Code Mapping**: Endpoints naturally map to code and user intent (`keys.createKey()` instead of `POST /keys`)
3. **Complex Operations**: Supports complex operations that don't map well to REST's resource model
4. **Flexibility**: Allows for more flexible request structures without being constrained by URL parameters
