The Unkey API uses HTTP RPC-style methods and generally follow the schema:

```bash
https://api.unkey.dev/{version}/{service}.{procedure}
```
For example `GET https://api.unkey.dev/v1/apis.listKeys` to list all keys for an API.

## HTTP Methods
We strictly use only `GET` and `POST` methods. `PUT` and `DELETE` are not used.


### GET
The `GET` methods is used for reading data. Filtering, sorting, or pagination is done via query parameters.

```
curl "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.getKey?keyId=key_123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ROOT_KEY>"
```


### POST
The `POST` method is used for creating, updating, and deleting data. Data is passed as `application/json` in the request body.


```
curl -XPOST "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ROOT_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "apiId": "api_123", "name": "My Key" }'
```
