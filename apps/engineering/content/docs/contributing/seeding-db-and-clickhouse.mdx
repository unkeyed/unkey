title: Seeding your Database and Clickhouse
---

**Important**: You must have a workspace created before using the seed service.

The seed service quickly populates test data for your dashboard. Run it with:

```bash
pnpm local --service=seed
# With specific workspace
pnpm local --service=seed --ws=your_workspace_id
```

## Available Seed Types

### API Request Logs (for /logs page)
- Generates basic API request data
- Creates varied response codes, paths, and timestamps
- Choose any volume of requests (10s to millions, even 10M+ is no problem)

### Rate Limit Events (for /ratelimits overview and logs)
- Create or select a namespace for rate limiting
- Specify event count (At least 1M is recommended for proper distribution)
- Generates both successful and rate-limited requests
- Automatically creates corresponding metrics data
- Option to create matching API logs

### Key Verification Events (for /apis overview and keys)
- Create a new API or use existing one
- Generate any number of keys (10-1,000 recommended)
- Create verification events with different outcomes
- Simulates valid, rate-limited, expired, disabled keys
- Specify event count (At least 1M is recommended for proper distribution)
- Automatically creates corresponding metrics data
- Option to create matching API logs
