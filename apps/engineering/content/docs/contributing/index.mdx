### Developing Unkey
<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Repository

    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  #### Setup local development
  Unkey provides a CLI to setup our local development environment. Run the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  pnpm local
  ```
  <Callout type="warn">
    Docker must be running for us to spin up the databases and supporting services.
  </Callout>

  You will be prompted to enter the following values:

  - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Your Clerk secret key.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your Clerk public key.



  We will create the required `.env` files depending on the selection you've made.

  </Step>

### About pnpm local command

If you have already set up Unkey locally once and wish to bypass the manual input questions the next time, you can do so by using flags with the pnpm local command.

    ```bash
    pnpm local [options]
    ```

List of available options:

- `--service=<service>`: Specifies which part of the application to develop. The values are `dashboard`, `api`, or `www`

- `--skip-env`: Skips the environment setup prompt if specified.

Example:

    ```bash
    pnpm local --service=dashboard --skip-env
    ```
