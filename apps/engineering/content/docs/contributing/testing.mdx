We use [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for our unit and integration tests. You can run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

## API Tests

`/apps/api` is our core product and needs to be heavily tested. Unit tests are not enough so we also use integration tests:

### `integration`

Full end to end tests require a running API either locally or in a deployed environment.
  ```bash
  cd apps/api

  UNKEY_BASE_URL=
  UNKEY_ROOT_KEY=
  pnpm test:integration
  ```
