This document outlines the process for deploying Unkey's frontend applications using Vercel.

## Overview

Unkey's frontend applications are deployed through Vercel's platform, which provides automated builds, previews, and deployments. The deployment process is designed to be automatic and requires minimal manual intervention.

## Frontend Applications

Unkey has several frontend applications deployed via Vercel:

- **Dashboard**: The main user interface for managing Unkey resources
- **Landing Page (www)**: The public-facing marketing website
- **Documentation**: The user and developer documentation site
- **Portal** (upcoming): The customer portal application

While these applications may be in different repositories, they all follow the same deployment pattern on Vercel.

## Deployment Process

### Production Deployments

Production deployments are automatically triggered when:

- Code is pushed directly to the `main` branch
- A pull request is merged into the `main` branch

The deployment process follows these steps:

1. Code changes are merged to `main`
2. Vercel automatically detects the change and starts the build process
3. The application is built according to its build configuration
4. Once the build succeeds, the new version is deployed to production
5. No manual approval steps are required

### Preview Deployments

Preview deployments are automatically created for every pull request:

1. When a pull request is opened, Vercel creates a preview deployment
2. Each commit to the PR triggers a new preview build
3. Vercel provides a unique URL for each preview deployment
4. Team members can visit this URL to review and test changes before merging
5. Preview deployments are useful for:
   - Visual verification of changes
   - Sharing with stakeholders for feedback
   - Testing functionality in an isolated environment

## Rollback Process

If issues are discovered after a deployment, you can roll back to a previous version:

1. Access the Vercel dashboard for the specific project
2. Navigate to the "Deployments" section
3. Find the previous successful deployment you want to roll back to
4. Click the three-dot menu (â‹®) next to that deployment
5. Select "Roll back" to make that version live again

## Best Practices

1. **Test thoroughly in preview deployments** before merging to `main`
2. **Coordinate frontend and API deployments** when changes depend on each other
3. **Verify critical user flows** after each production deployment
4. **Document significant changes** in PR descriptions for better tracking
