## Common Error Patterns

Find your runbook by matching the error message you're seeing:

- **`unable to decrypt, fetch error: 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable`** â†’ [Agent Deployment Issues](/docs/runbooks/services/agent/deployment-issues)


## Adding New Runbooks

When you encounter a new issue:
1. Note the exact error message you see
2. Add the error pattern to this index 
3. Create a detailed runbook with investigation and resolution steps
4. Link from this index to your new runbook
