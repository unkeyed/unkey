# Durable Workflows with Restate

Unkey uses [Restate](https://restate.dev) for durable workflow execution in critical deployment operations. Restate provides:

- **Durable Execution**: Operations resume from the last successful step after failures
- **Automatic Retries**: Transient failures are retried automatically
- **State Management**: Workflow state is managed by Restate, not in our database
- **Observability**: Built-in UI to inspect running workflows

## Core Concepts

### Virtual Objects

Virtual Objects provide key-based concurrency control - only one handler can execute at a time per object key. Example: `DeploymentService` is keyed by `project_id`, ensuring only one deployment per project runs at a time.

### Durable Steps

Each `restate.Run()` step executes once and stores its result. After failures, workflows resume from stored results without re-executing completed steps.

### Service Communication

Workflows call each other using blocking (`Object.Request`) or fire-and-forget (`WorkflowSend.Send`) patterns. See the Go implementation files for examples.

## Workflow Services

### DeploymentService

**Location:** `go/apps/ctrl/workflows/deploy/`
**Proto:** `go/proto/hydra/v1/deployment.proto`
**Key:** `project_id`
**Operations:** Deploy, Rollback, Promote

Handles deployment lifecycle: building containers via Krane, polling status, scraping OpenAPI specs, and assigning domains.

See: [Deployment Service](./deployment-service)

### RoutingService

**Location:** `go/apps/ctrl/workflows/routing/`
**Proto:** `go/proto/hydra/v1/routing.proto`
**Key:** `project_id`
**Operations:** AssignDomains, SwitchDomains

Manages atomic domain and gateway configuration changes across control plane (domains DB) and data plane (gateway configs).

See: [Routing Service](./routing-service)

### CertificateService

**Location:** `go/apps/ctrl/workflows/certificate/`
**Proto:** `go/proto/hydra/v1/certificate.proto`
**Key:** `domain`
**Operations:** ProcessChallenge

Handles ACME certificate challenges and issuance for custom domains.

## Configuration

Services auto-register with Restate on startup via `go/apps/ctrl/run.go`. Config fields (see `go/apps/ctrl/config.go`):

- `Restate.IngressURL`: Restate ingress endpoint for invoking workflows
- `Restate.AdminURL`: Restate admin endpoint for service registration
- `Restate.HttpPort`: Port where ctrl listens for Restate HTTP requests
- `Restate.RegisterAs`: Public URL of this service for self-registration

## Error Handling

- **Terminal Errors**: Use `restate.TerminalError(err, statusCode)` for business logic failures that shouldn't retry
- **Transient Errors**: Return regular errors for automatic retry

## Best Practices

1. **Idempotent Steps**: Use UPSERT instead of INSERT for database operations
2. **Named Steps**: Always use `restate.WithName("step name")` for observability
3. **Small Steps**: Break operations into focused, single-purpose steps
4. **Virtual Objects**: Use for automatic serialization instead of manual locking

## Observability

Restate UI (port 9070) shows running/completed invocations, step execution history, failures, and retries.
