## Overview

Unkey uses multiple MySQL databases that are automatically created and initialized during development:

- **unkey**: Main application database containing APIs, keys, workspaces, and related data
- **hydra**: Workflow orchestration engine database for managing deployment workflows
- **partition_00X**: Dataplane partition database

## Schema Files

Schema definitions are maintained in separate files:

- `go/pkg/db/schema.sql` - Main Unkey application schema
- `go/pkg/hydra/store/schema.sql` - Hydra workflow engine schema
- `go/pkg/partition/schema.sq.` - Dataplane schema

## Docker Development Setup

During local development, schemas are automatically applied via Docker:

### File Structure
```
deployment/
├── Dockerfile.mysql          # MySQL container definition
├── init-databases.sql        # Database creation and user permissions
└── docker-compose.yaml       # Service orchestration

go/pkg/
├── db/schema.sql             # Main application schema  
└── hydra/store/schema.sql    # Hydra workflow schema
```

### Initialization Order

The MySQL container applies files from `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` in alphabetical order:

1. **00-init-databases.sql** - Creates databases and grants permissions
2. **01-main-schema.sql** - Creates all main application tables in `unkey` database
3. **02-partition_schema.sql - Creates the partition tables in the `partition_001` database
4. **03-hydra-schema.sql** - Creates workflow tables in `hydra` database

### Database-Qualified Table Names

All schema files use fully-qualified table names to ensure tables are created in the correct database:

```sql
-- Main schema (go/pkg/db/schema.sql)
CREATE TABLE `unkey`.`apis` (
  `id` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
  -- ...
);

-- Hydra schema (go/pkg/hydra/store/schema.sql)  
CREATE TABLE `hydra`.`workflow_executions` (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  -- ...
);
```

## Schema Management Strategy

### Current State (Drizzle-First)

Currently, the **primary source of truth** for the `unkey` database is the Drizzle schema in `internal/db/`. This is used to:

- Generate and run migrations against PlanetScale in production
- Define the actual database structure

The `go/pkg/db/schema.sql` file is **manually maintained** and must be kept in sync with the Drizzle schema. Engineers are responsible for ensuring this file matches the current database structure.

### Future State (SQL-First)

In the future, we plan to reverse this workflow:
- `go/pkg/db/schema.sql` will become the primary source of truth
- Drizzle schema will be generated from the SQL schema
- This will enable better tooling and consistency

### Hydra Database

The `hydra` database uses `go/pkg/hydra/store/schema.sql` as its source of truth since it's Go-native and doesn't use Drizzle.

## SQLC Integration

The project uses [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/) to generate type-safe Go code from SQL queries:

- Query definitions: `go/pkg/db/queries/*.sql`
- Generated code: `go/pkg/db/queries.sql.go`
- Configuration: `go/pkg/db/sqlc.yaml`

### Regenerating SQLC Code

After schema changes, regenerate the SQLC code:

```bash
cd go
go generate ./...
```
Do not use `sqlc generate` directly as we have some custom logic during the generation step.

## Making Schema Changes

### For Unkey Database (Current Workflow)

1. **Update Drizzle schema** in `internal/db/` (primary source of truth)
2. **Run migrations** against PlanetScale using Drizzle
3. **Manually update** `go/pkg/db/schema.sql` to match the Drizzle changes
4. **Update SQLC queries** if needed in `go/pkg/db/queries/`
5. **Regenerate SQLC code** with `go generate ./...`
6. **Rebuild Docker containers** for local development:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### For Hydra Database

1. **Update the schema file** `go/pkg/hydra/store/schema.sql`
2. **Rebuild Docker containers** to apply changes:
   ```bash
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq); docker system prune -f; docker volume prune --all -f
   docker compose up --build
   ```
