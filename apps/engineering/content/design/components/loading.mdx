# Loading Component

The Loading component provides a sleek, animated loading indicator featuring three pulsating circles. It's designed to provide visual feedback during asynchronous operations or loading states in your application.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Loading, Button } from "@unkey/ui";

function MyComponent() {
  return <Loading />;
}
```

## Examples

### Default

<LoadingExample />

### Size and Segment duration

<CustomSizeAndDuration />

### Customization

The Loading component is highly customizable:

- **Color**: Inherits the text color of its parent element through the `fill-current` class
- **Size**: Adjustable through width and height props
- **Animation Speed**: Configurable animation duration
- **Responsive**: Adapts seamlessly to different container sizes

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `size` | `number` | `24` | Sets both width and height of the loading indicator |
| `dur` | `number` | `125` | Animation duration in milliseconds per segment |
| `className` | `string` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes to apply |

The component also accepts all standard HTML attributes supported by the underlying SVG element.

## Accessibility

The Loading component is built with accessibility in mind:
- Includes appropriate ARIA attributes
- Provides visual feedback without relying on color alone
- Maintains good contrast ratios

## Best Practices

- Use consistent sizes within the same context
- Place the loader in a logical location relative to the content being loaded
- Consider using a minimum display duration to prevent flickering
- Ensure sufficient contrast between the loader and its background
