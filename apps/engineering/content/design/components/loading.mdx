---
import { LoadingExample, CustomSizeAndDuration, DotsLineExample } from "./loading/loading.example";

## Usage

```tsx
import { Loading, Button } from "@unkey/ui";

function MyComponent() {
  return <Loading />;
}
```

## Examples

### Default

<LoadingExample />

### Size and Segment duration

<CustomSizeAndDuration />

### Dots Loading

<DotsLineExample />

### Customization

The Loading component is highly customizable:

- **Color**: Inherits the text color of its parent element through the `fill-current` class
- **Size**: Adjustable through width and height props
- **Animation Speed**: Configurable animation duration
- **Responsive**: Adapts seamlessly to different container sizes

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `size` | `number` | `18` (spinner), `24` (dots) | Sets both width and height of the loading indicator |
| `duration` | `string` | `"125ms"` | Animation duration in milliseconds per segment (for spinner type) or "0.75s" for dots type |
| `type` | `"spinner" \| "dots"` | `"spinner"` | Type of loading animation to display |
| `className` | `string` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes to apply |

The component also accepts all standard SVG element props.

## Accessibility

The Loading component is built with accessibility in mind:
- Includes appropriate ARIA attributes
- Provides visual feedback without relying on color alone
- Maintains good contrast ratios

## Best Practices

- Use consistent sizes within the same context
- Place the loader in a logical location relative to the content being loaded
- Consider using a minimum display duration to prevent flickering
- Ensure sufficient contrast between the loader and its background
