# Loading Component

The Loading component is a simple yet customizable animated loading indicator that displays three pulsating circles in a row.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Loading } from "@unkey/ui";

function MyComponent() {
  return <Loading />;
}
```

## Examples

### Default Loading

<LoadingExample />

### Custom Size

<LoadingCustomExample />

### Custom Animation Speed

<LoadingWithDurationExample />

### Custom Color

The loading indicator inherits its color from the parent element's text color using the `fill-current` class.

## Props

The Loading component accepts the following props:

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `width` | `number` | `24` | The width of the loading indicator in pixels |
| `height` | `number` | `24` | The height of the loading indicator in pixels |
| `dur` | `string` | `"0.75s"` | The duration of one complete animation cycle |

Additionally, the component accepts all standard SVG element props as it renders an SVG under the hood.

## Implementation Details

The loading animation is implemented using SVG animations (`<animate>`) that smoothly transition the radius of three circles between their maximum (3) and minimum (0.2) values. The animations are chained together with precise timing to create a smooth wave-like effect.

The component is built with accessibility in mind and can be styled using Tailwind CSS classes through its parent elements.
