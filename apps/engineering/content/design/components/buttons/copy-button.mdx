import { Default } from "./copy-button.examples"

The `CopyButton` component provides a simple way to copy text to the clipboard with visual feedback. It extends the base Button component and includes built-in copy functionality with proper accessibility support.

## Features

- Visual feedback with icon change on copy (TaskUnchecked â†’ TaskChecked)
- Accessible with screen reader support and ARIA labels
- Automatic reset after 2 seconds
- Extends ButtonProps for full button customization
- Analytics support with optional src prop
- Prevents event propagation to parent elements
- TypeScript support with proper typing

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `value` | `string` | **Required** | The text content to be copied to clipboard |
| `src` | `string?` | `undefined` | Optional source identifier for analytics tracking |
| `variant` | `ButtonVariant` | `"outline"` | Button variant (outline, ghost, primary, etc.) |
| `className` | `string?` | `undefined` | Additional CSS classes to apply to the button |

The component also accepts all standard Button props.

## Usage

<Default />

## Behavior

1. **Click Handling**: On click, the button copies the provided text to the clipboard
2. **Visual Feedback**: The icon changes from TaskUnchecked to TaskChecked state
3. **Auto Reset**: After 2 seconds, the icon reverts to its original state
4. **Event Prevention**: Parent click events are prevented from triggering (`e.stopPropagation`)
5. **Analytics**: If provided, the `src` prop is passed to analytics for tracking

## Accessibility

The component includes comprehensive accessibility features:

- **ARIA Label**: `aria-label="Copy to clipboard"` for screen readers
- **Screen Reader Text**: Hidden "Copy" text for additional context
- **Title Attribute**: `title="Copy to clipboard"` for tooltip on hover
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus states with `focus:ring-0 focus:border-grayA-6`
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard navigation support inherited from Button component

## Styling

The component includes default styling:

- Fixed dimensions: `w-6 h-6` (24x24px)
- Focus states: `focus:ring-0 focus:border-grayA-6`
- Icons: Full-size icons with `w-full h-full`
- Default variant: `outline` for subtle appearance

## Best Practices

- Use the `src` prop for analytics tracking when copying sensitive data
- Provide meaningful `value` content for better user experience
- Consider the button's context when choosing variants
- Ensure sufficient contrast for the button in your design
- Test with screen readers to verify accessibility
