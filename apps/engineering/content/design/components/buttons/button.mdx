# Button

A versatile button component that supports various styles, states, and interactive features. Button is built with accessibility in mind and provides consistent interaction patterns across all variants.

Each button can be customized with different variants, colors, and sizes, making it adaptable to any UI context. All buttons include proper focus states, loading indicators, and keyboard interactions.

## Basic Variants

Button comes in three basic variants that serve different UI purposes:

### Primary

The default button style with a solid background. Use for primary actions and main call-to-actions.

<PrimaryExample />

### Outline

Button with transparent background and visible border. Ideal for secondary actions that don't require as much visual emphasis.

  <OutlineExample />

### Ghost

Button with no background or border until interacted with. Perfect for tertiary actions or when space is limited.

<GhostExample />

## Color Variants

Each button variant can be combined with different color schemes to convey the nature of the action:

### Danger - Primary

Solid background danger variant for destructive actions that should be clearly highlighted.

<DangerPrimaryExample />

### Danger - Outline

Danger variant with outline style. Use for destructive actions that require less visual prominence.

<DangerOutlineExample />

### Danger - Ghost

Minimal danger variant. Suitable for destructive actions in tight UI spaces or alongside other content.

### Warning - Primary

Warning variant with solid background for actions that require caution but aren't destructive.

<WarningPrimaryExample />

### Warning - Outline

Warning variant with outline style for secondary cautionary actions.

### Warning - Ghost

Warning variant with ghost style for tertiary cautionary actions.

### Success - Primary

Success variant with solid background for positive or confirming actions.

<SuccessPrimaryExample />

### Success - Outline

Success variant with outline style for secondary positive actions.

<SuccessOutlineExample />

### Success - Ghost

Success variant with ghost style for subtle positive actions.

<SuccessGhostExample />

### Info - Primary

Info variant with solid background for positive or confirming actions.

<InfoPrimaryExample />

### Info - Outline

Info variant with outline style for secondary positive actions.

<InfoOutlineExample />

### Info - Ghost

### With Keyboard Shortcuts

Buttons can display and respond to keyboard shortcuts for improved accessibility and power-user workflows.

## Additional Features

The Button component includes some additional features not shown in the examples above:

### Legacy Variant Support

For backward compatibility, the component supports legacy variants:

- `default` will be mapped to `primary` variant
- `destructive` will be mapped to `primary` variant with `danger` color

### Shape Variants

For special layouts, buttons can use the `shape` prop:

<ShapeVariantsExample />

## Props

The Button component accepts all standard HTML button attributes plus the following:

<AutoTypeTable
  name="DocumentedButtonProps"
  path="../../internal/ui/src/components/button.tsx"
/>

## Usage Guidelines

When using the Button component:

- **Hierarchy**: Maintain a clear visual hierarchy with your button choices
  - Use **primary** buttons for main actions and primary call-to-actions
  - Use **outline** buttons for secondary actions
  - Use **ghost** buttons for tertiary actions or in dense UIs
- **Color semantics**: Apply color variants based on the action's impact:
  - **Default** for neutral or standard actions
  - **Success** for positive, confirming, or creative actions
  - **Warning** for cautionary actions that require attention
  - **Danger** for destructive or irreversible actions
- **Interaction states**:
  - Ensure **loading** state is shown during asynchronous operations to prevent multiple submissions
  - Use **disabled** state appropriately for actions that are currently unavailable
  - Test that focus states are clearly visible for keyboard navigation
- **Sizing and spacing**:
  - Use appropriate **size** based on the button's importance and the available space
  - Maintain consistent spacing between buttons in a group (recommend 16px/1rem)
  - For button groups, maintain consistent sizing within the group
- **Content guidelines**:
  - Use concise, action-oriented text (e.g., "Save changes" instead of "Submit")
  - Add icons to enhance meaning, but avoid overloading buttons with too many elements
  - For destructive actions, consider using explicit verbs ("Delete" instead of "Remove")
- **Accessibility**:
  - Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background (WCAG AA minimum)
  - Add appropriate aria attributes for complex button behaviors
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - On mobile, ensure buttons are at least 44×44px (touch target size)
  - Consider stacking buttons vertically on very small screens
