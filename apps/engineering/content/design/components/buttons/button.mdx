## Overview

The Button component provides a comprehensive button system for creating interactive elements throughout your application. It's designed to handle various use cases with multiple variants, color schemes, sizes, and states while maintaining accessibility and consistent styling.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "@unkey/ui";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Primary Action</Button>
      <Button variant="outline">Secondary Action</Button>
      <Button variant="ghost" color="danger">Destructive Action</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Variants
The Button comes in three basic variants

#### Primary
The default button style with a solid background. Use for primary actions and main call-to-actions.

<PrimaryExample />

#### Outline
Button with transparent background and visible border. Ideal for secondary actions that don't require as much visual emphasis.

<OutlineExample />

#### Ghost
Button with no background or border until interacted with. Perfect for tertiary actions or when space is limited.

<GhostExample />

### Color Variants
Each button variant can be combined with different color schemes to convey the nature of the action.

#### Danger Variants
Solid background danger variant for destructive actions that should be clearly highlighted.
