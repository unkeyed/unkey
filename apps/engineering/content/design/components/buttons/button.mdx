## Basic Variants

Button comes in three basic variants that serve different UI purposes:

### Primary

The default button style with a solid background. Use for primary actions and main call-to-actions.

<PrimaryExample />

### Outline

Button with transparent background and visible border. Ideal for secondary actions that don't require as much visual emphasis.

<OutlineExample />

### Ghost

Button with no background or border until interacted with. Perfect for tertiary actions or when space is limited.

<GhostExample />

## Color Variants

Each button variant can be combined with different color schemes to convey the nature of the action:

### Danger - Primary

Solid background danger variant for destructive actions that should be clearly highlighted.

### Danger - Outline

### Legacy Variant Support

For backward compatibility, the component supports legacy variants:

- `default` will be mapped to `primary` variant
- `destructive` will be mapped to `primary` variant with `danger` color

### Shape Variants

For special layouts, buttons can use the `shape` prop:

<ShapeVariantsExample />

## Usage Guidelines

When using the Button component:

- **Hierarchy**: Maintain a clear visual hierarchy with your button choices
  - Use **primary** buttons for main actions and primary call-to-actions
  - Use **outline** buttons for secondary actions
  - Use **ghost** buttons for tertiary actions or in dense UIs
- **Color semantics**: Apply color variants based on the action's impact:
  - **Default** for neutral or standard actions
  - **Success** for positive, confirming, or creative actions
  - **Warning** for cautionary actions that require attention
  - **Danger** for destructive or irreversible actions
- **Interaction states**:
  - Ensure **loading** state is shown during asynchronous operations to prevent multiple submissions
  - Use **disabled** state appropriately for actions that are currently unavailable
  - Test that focus states are clearly visible for keyboard navigation
- **Sizing and spacing**:
  - Use appropriate **size** based on the button's importance and the available space
  - Maintain consistent spacing between buttons in a group (recommend 16px/1rem)
  - For button groups, maintain consistent sizing within the group
- **Content guidelines**:
  - Use concise, action-oriented text (e.g., "Save changes" instead of "Submit")
  - Add icons to enhance meaning, but avoid overloading buttons with too many elements
  - For destructive actions, consider using explicit verbs ("Delete" instead of "Remove")
- **Accessibility**:
  - Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background (WCAG AA minimum)
  - Add appropriate aria attributes for complex button behaviors
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - On mobile, ensure buttons are at least 44Ã—44px (touch target size)
  - Consider stacking buttons vertically on very small screens
