# FormCheckbox

A comprehensive checkbox component that combines labels, descriptions, and validation states. Perfect for creating accessible, user-friendly forms that require selection inputs with proper labeling and helpful context.

## Default

The default FormCheckbox includes a label and optional description text, providing clear context for users.

<DefaultFormCheckboxVariant />

## Checkbox States

### Required Field

Use the required prop to indicate mandatory fields. This automatically adds a "Required" tag to the label.

<RequiredFormCheckboxVariant />

### Required Field with Error

When a required field has an error, the "Required" tag changes to error styling to draw more attention.

<RequiredWithErrorFormCheckboxVariant />

### Optional Field

Use the optional prop to explicitly indicate non-mandatory fields. This adds an "Optional" badge to the label.

<OptionalFormCheckboxVariant />

### Success State

Indicates successful validation or acceptance of selection. The success icon and text provide positive feedback.

<SuccessFormCheckboxVariant />

### Warning State

Used for potentially impactful selections that should be made with caution. Includes a warning icon and explanatory text.

<WarningFormCheckboxVariant />

### Error State

Shows validation errors or other issues that need user attention. Features prominent error styling and message.

<ErrorFormCheckboxVariant />

### Disabled State

Apply when the field should be non-interactive, such as during form submission or based on other field values.

<DisabledFormCheckboxVariant />

### Checked State

Pre-selected checkbox with an initial checked state that users can toggle.

<CheckedFormCheckboxVariant />

## Variants

### Outline Variant

A subtler alternative to the primary variant with transparent background when checked.

<OutlineFormCheckboxVariant />

### Ghost Variant

The most minimal styling for checkboxes that need less visual emphasis.

<GhostFormCheckboxVariant />

### Different Sizes

Checkboxes can be sized appropriately for different UI needs.

## Complex Usage

Example of FormCheckboxes with multiple props configured for a specific use case, such as a cookie consent form.

## Props

The FormCheckbox component extends the standard Checkbox component props with additional form-specific properties:

<AutoTypeTable
    name="DocumentedFormCheckboxProps"
    path="../../internal/ui/src/components/form/form-checkbox.tsx"
/>

## Accessibility

FormCheckbox is built with accessibility in mind:

- Labels are properly associated with checkboxes using htmlFor/id
- Error messages are announced to screen readers using role="alert"
- Required fields are marked both visually and via aria-required
- Helper text is linked to checkboxes using aria-describedby
- Error states are indicated using aria-invalid
- Checkboxes maintain proper focus states for keyboard navigation

## Best Practices

When using the FormCheckbox component:

- Always provide clear, concise labels that describe the action being taken
- Use description text to provide additional context about the implications of selection
- Write labels as positive statements (what will happen if checked)
- Keep error messages specific and actionable
- Use required fields sparingly and logically
- Group related checkboxes together with a descriptive heading
- Consider the mobile experience with appropriate touch targets
- Maintain consistent validation patterns across your form
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation to ensure accessibility

## Layout Guidelines

- Labels should be positioned to the right of the checkbox
- Error messages should appear immediately below the checkbox
- Description text should be helpful but not too lengthy
- Consider using the optional badge for clarity in forms with many fields
- For groups of related checkboxes, consider using a fieldset with legend
- Maintain consistent spacing between multiple checkboxes in a group
- Use appropriate visual hierarchy when nesting checkboxes (e.g., for "select all" patterns)
