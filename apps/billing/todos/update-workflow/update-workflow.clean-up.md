# Cleanup Plan for Glossary Update Test Code

## Issues Identified

1. **Excessive Nesting**: The code has deeply nested if/else statements and try/catch blocks that make it hard to follow.
2. **No Real-time Progress Tracking**: Results are only available after all tests complete.
3. **Complex Cleanup Logic**: Cleanup logic is embedded within test execution, creating nested conditionals.
4. **Unnecessary Template Literals**: Several console.log statements use template literals unnecessarily.
5. **Redundant Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks are used when Trigger's result objects already handle errors.

## Planned Changes

1. **Use Trigger Metadata API**:
   - Replace local results array with metadata for real-time visibility
   - Track test progress, results, and cleanup status in metadata

2. **Flatten Nested Conditionals**:
   - Use early returns to reduce nesting
   - Extract cleanup logic to a separate function

3. **Simplify Error Handling**:
   - Remove unnecessary try/catch blocks
   - Rely on Trigger's result objects for error handling

4. **Fix Template Literals**:
   - Replace unnecessary template literals with regular strings

5. **Improve Cleanup Tracking**:
   - Track cleanup status in metadata
   - Make cleanup results more accessible

## Implementation Approach

1. Create a separate function for cleanup logic
2. Use metadata to track test progress and results
3. Flatten conditionals with early returns
4. Fix linter errors related to template literals
5. Document changes in this file

## Expected Benefits

1. More readable code with less nesting
2. Real-time visibility into test progress and results
3. Cleaner separation of concerns between test execution and cleanup
4. Easier maintenance and debugging
