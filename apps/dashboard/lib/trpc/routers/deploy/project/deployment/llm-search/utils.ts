Remember:
${operatorsByField}
- Use exact matches (is) for status and environment fields
- Use contains for branch names to match partial branch patterns
- Time fields (startTime, endTime) use exact matches with numeric values
- Since field uses exact matches with time expressions

Special handling rules:
1. Map common terms to appropriate fields:
   - Status terms ("failed", "completed", "pending", "building") → status field
   - Environment terms ("production", "preview", "prod", "staging") → environment field
   - Branch patterns ("main", "master", "develop", "feature", "hotfix") → branch field
   - Time expressions ("yesterday", "24h", "week", "today") → since field

2. CRITICAL: Status disambiguation rules:
- "active" or "ready" ALWAYS means completed deployments (live/successful deployments)
- "running" means deployments currently in the deployment process (building + pending)
- "in progress" means deployments currently being deployed (building)
- "live" means completed deployments
- "successful" means completed deployments

Status aliases and variations:
   - "active", "ready", "success", "successful", "done", "live", "finished successfully" → "completed"
   - "in progress", "building", "deploying" → "building"
   - "pending", "queued", "waiting" → "pending"
   - "failed", "error", "broken" → "failed"
   - "running", "currently running", "still processing" → "building" and "pending" (deployment process in progress)
   - "finished" → "completed" and "failed" (both finished states)

3. Environment aliases:
   - "prod" → "production"
   - "staging", "stage" → "preview"

4. Time expression patterns:
   - "recent", "lately" → "24h"
   - "today" → "today"
   - "yesterday" → "yesterday"
   - "this week" → "week"

Error Handling Rules:
1. Invalid operators: Default to "is" for status/environment, "contains" for branch
2. Empty values: Skip filters with empty or whitespace-only values
3. Invalid status values: Map to closest valid grouped status

Ambiguity Resolution Priority:
1. Status-based searches when deployment state terms are used
2. Environment-based searches for deployment target terms
3. Branch-based searches for code branch patterns
4. Time-based searches for temporal expressions

Output Validation:
1. Required fields must be present: field, filters
2. Filters must have: operator, value
3. Values must be non-empty strings
4. Operators must match field configuration
5. Field names must be valid: status, environment, branch, startTime, endTime, since
6. Status values must be one of: pending, building, completed, failed
7. Environment values must be one of: production, preview

Additional Context:
- Deployments have grouped statuses for filtering: pending, building, completed, failed
- Building status represents multiple internal states: downloading_docker_image, building_rootfs, uploading_rootfs, creating_vm, booting_vm, assigning_domains
- Users see and refer to the grouped statuses: Pending/Queued, Building/In Progress, Ready/Active/Success, Failed/Error
- Backend automatically expands grouped statuses to actual internal statuses for filtering
- Environment is either production or preview
- Branch names can contain various patterns (feature/, hotfix/, release/, etc.)
- Time-based filtering helps find recent or historical deployments
- Only use the grouped status values (pending, building, completed, failed) in filter outputs

Advanced Examples:

# Multi-status with Environment
Query: "all failed and completed production deployments"
Result: [
  {
    field: "status",
    filters: [
      { operator: "is", value: "failed" },
      { operator: "is", value: "completed" }
    ]
  },
  {
    field: "environment",
    filters: [
      { operator: "is", value: "production" }
    ]
  }
]

# Branch Pattern Matching
Query: "deployments from feature and hotfix branches"
Result: [
  {
    field: "branch",
    filters: [
      { operator: "contains", value: "feature" },
      { operator: "contains", value: "hotfix" }
    ]
  }
]

# Status Category Searches
Query: "show me all ready or active deployments"
Result: [
  {
    field: "status",
    filters: [
      { operator: "is", value: "pending" },
      { operator: "is", value: "building" }
    ]
  }
]`;
