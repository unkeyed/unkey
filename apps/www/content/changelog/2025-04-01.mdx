## New Features

### Pricing Updates

While this isn't a new feature, we've made some updates to our pricing plans to better serve everyone whether you are just starting out or scaling a project.

- **Larger Free Tier** : We've significantly increased our free tier! You now get 150,000 requests per month completely free, up from the original 2,500. This allows you to thoroughly test Unkey and start scaling your project before entering your credit card.

- **Simplified Pricing** : We've streamlined our pricing model to focus solely on requests. We've removed the separate charges for key verifications and standalone rate limit verifications, making it much simpler to understand and predict your costs.

- **Tiered Pricing** : We're introducing tiered pricing starting at just $25. This gives you more flexibility to choose the plan that best fits your needs as you scale, we also reduced the price significantly, below is an example of **10M** requests in a month on the new and old pricing:

| Old Price | New Price |
|:---------:|:---------:|
| $1010.00  | $250.00   |

- **No Overage Charges** : We will no longer charge for overages. If you exceed your monthly request limit, we won't charge you but send you an email congratulating your success. If you continue to exceed the tier every month, we will ask you to upgrade to the next tier.

We believe these changes will make Unkey an even more attractive and accessible solution for developers of all sizes and allow you to scale without worrying about your bill.
