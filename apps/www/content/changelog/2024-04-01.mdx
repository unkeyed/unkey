## A new look

Unkey has a new look! We have updated our website to provide a more modern and hand crafted feel. Our team spent countless hours designing and developing the new site. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

## A new domain

With the launch of the new website, we have also moved to a new domain. You can now find us at [unkey.com](https://unkey.com). We always wanted to have a .com domain, and we are excited to finally have it.


## A new team member

We are excited to welcome a new team member to Unkey. [Rodz](https://x.com/guilherme_rodz) has joined us as a design engineer. He will be working on new features and improving the dashboard to be more user friendly and intuitive.

## Unlimited Keys on pro plan

When you upgrade to the pro plan, you now have unlimited keys. This means you can create as many keys as you need without worrying about hitting a limit. We hope this change makes it easier for you to manage your keys and use Unkey to its full potential.
