## Documentation refresh

We have updated our documentation to provide more detailed information on how to use Unkey. Our goal is to make it easier for you to get started and find the information you need. We hope you find the new documentation helpful. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know.

## Unkey Local Development

We have dramatically improved our local development experience. With Unkey Local Development, you can now develop and contribute to Unkey without the need for Planetscale and other dependencies. This feature is perfect for developers who want to contribute to Unkey.

Check out our [documentation](https://www.unkey.com/docs/contributing/getting-started) to learn more about Unkey Local Development.

## Migrating to Unkey

We added a new API endpoint that allows you to migrate your existing keys to Unkey. This allows for zero down time migration and makes it easy to handle large key migrations. You can find more information in our [documentation](https://www.unkey.com/docs/migrations/keys).

## Go SDK
