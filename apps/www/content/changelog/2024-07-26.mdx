For the past two weeks, the team has been laser-focused on tackling technical debt, improving our documentation, and crushing UI bugs.


![Unkey Turso Cache store](/images/changelog/2024-07-26/unkey-turso.jpeg)

We collaborated with the team at [Turso](https://turso.tech) to introduce a new cache-store. This cache store allows using [embedded replicas](https://docs.turso.tech/features/embedded-replicas/introduction) or remote Turso DB. You can read about implementing your cache store in our [documentation](https://www.unkey.com/docs/libraries/ts/cache/overview#libsql-turso).

## Documentation improvements

Our documentation has been getting some serious improvements in the past month. First, we introduced a new layout that provides a better way to find what you are looking for based on your use case.

We also introduced new getting started guides that can help you get started with [ratelimiting](https://www.unkey.com/docs/quickstart/ratelimiting/nextjs) or with [identities](https://www.unkey.com/docs/quickstart/identities/shared-ratelimits)

We also wrote a new guide on ratelimiting your [One Time Passcodes](https://www.unkey.com/blog/ratelimiting-otp) for DDOS and bot protection.
