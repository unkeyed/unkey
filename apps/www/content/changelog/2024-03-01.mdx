## Standalone ratelimiting

We are introducing standalone ratelimiting. With this feature, you can rate limit anything while still leveraging the power of Unkey. Our ratelimiting feature works similarly to our keys, providing low global latency and detailed analytics. Moreover, you can configure overrides for specific identifiers, giving you more flexibility.

You can [check out a demo](https://unkey.com/ratelimit) that shows our synchronous and asynchronous implementation versus a Redis-based ratelimiter.
