## A shiny new web experience

We just spent the last week making our website, well not just a random one page of ideas we had in the beginning. Unkey makes API management easy, and we wanted our site to reflect that. Our site now has a cohesive feel, and is easy to navigate.

Next up! Our dashboard UI is getting a make over, we might even have a dark mode.

### Usage based invalidation

AI is incredible popular, and part of creating your AI product is finding a way to limit a users usage, whether they are paying or you are offering a free trial. Unkey now has usage based invalidation, where you can set how many times a key can be used before we invalidate it. Simply pass in the remaining property with a value and we take care of the rest.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <UNKEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"apiId":"<API_ID>",
"remaining": 100
}'
```

Then when you validate your key we will return two properties, is it valid and how many requests remain.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.verifyKey \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"key": "<NEW_KEY>"
}'
```

Which will return if the key is valid, and the **`remaining`** value which represents how many verifications are remaining after the current one.

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "remaining": 99
}
```

### Update your keys.

Need to update ratelimits? Change some metadata? Maybe you want to use our new remaining to create tokens and update them when a user pays. This is all now possible with our update endpoint.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.updateLey \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <UNKEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "keyId": "<KEY_ID>",
    "remaining": 200,
  }'
```

You can read about this in our [documentation](https://unkey.com/docs/api-reference/keys/update).
