Introducing the Unkey toolbox, an opinionated set of tools designed to streamline creating new APIs. The toolbox comes packed with features that allow you to create performant and secure APIs with high quality documentation.

The toolbox is built with the following technologies:

- Cloudflare workers
- Hono
- Turso
- Your choice of Prisma or Drizzle
- Documentation built on the Fumadocs open source project

Of course the toolbox also includes Unkey in a variety of ways, including keys, ratelimiting and our open source cache package.

## Getting Started with the Unkey Toolbox

Getting started with the Unkey Toolbox is easy! Just use `npx @unkey/toolbox` from your terminal and following the CLI prompts. Once you run the CLI you’ll be able to play with our demo endpoints, and documentation.

## What’s next for the toolbox?

We want to add more features to the toolbox including new database providers, billing and of course more endpoint examples. Our toolbox is open source just like the rest of Unkey so you can drive what gets built or contribute yourself.

Check out the [repository](https://github.com/unkeyed/toolbox) to request features and how all the code works.
