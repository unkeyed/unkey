Unkey just launched our [API Playground!](https://play.unkey.com) This is a try-before-you-buy experience that allows developers to gain a basic understanding of Unkey's features.

## What Is It

The Unkey [API Playground](https://play.unkey.com) is a playground… Yes, it's just a place for you to test out our API before committing to an Unkey account. It's set up to accept curl commands and will guide you through a typical use case. This meets the definition I found most interesting on dictionary.com: “an arena of operation or activity”.

## No Strings Attached

No need to sign up for an account until you're ready to start authenticating your API. Simply navigate to the API Playground and mess around all you like. The Playground showcases the most common uses you might make while using Unkey. While it's not an exhaustive list of features Unkey provides, it's a good starting point for new users.

## Using The Playground

The process is simple and user-friendly:

1. Visit the Unkey [API Playground](https://play.unkey.com) webpage.
2. Use the interactive experience to learn about the features of unkey.
3. View real-time responses of each of our API calls.

The playground is structured linearly and uses real Unkey API calls. You're encouraged to experiment with your own inputs but you can of course use the prefilled examples. It's simple and quick so you can get back to coding what you love.

## But Why?

If you're a new developer unfamiliar with API authentication,
Or perhaps you're a seasoned developer who doesn't feel like reading docs for the 8th time today,
Or you simply need something to occupy your time while appearing to be productive,
In any case, if you or your company are seeking API authentication, then Unkey is a quick and efficient solution to consider and the [API Playground](https://play.unkey.com) is a good starting point.

## Conclusion
So jump into our [API Playground](https://play.unkey.com) and mess around. Make some calls and get a feel for how Unkey works. Feel free to jump into our [Discord](https://unkey.com/discord) and ask questions or tell us what you think.
