Unkey just launched our [API Playground!](https://play.unkey.com) This is a try-before-you-buy experience that allows developers to gain a basic understanding of Unkey's features.

## What Is It

The Unkey [API Playground](https://play.unkey.com) is a playground… Yes, it's just a place to test our API before committing to an Unkey account. It is set up to guide you through a typical use case with an interactive experience. This meets the definition I found most interesting on dictionary.com: “an arena of operation or activity.”

## No Strings Attached

You do not need to sign up for an account until you're ready to start authenticating your API. Navigate to the API Playground and mess around all you like. The Playground showcases the most common uses of Unkey, our API keys. While it's not an exhaustive list of features Unkey provides, it's a good starting point for new users.

## Using The Playground

The process is simple and user-friendly:

1. Visit the Unkey [API Playground](https://play.unkey.com) webpage.
2. Use the interactive experience to learn about the features of unkey.
3. View real-time responses of each of our API calls.

The playground is structured linearly and uses actual Unkey API calls. You're encouraged to experiment with your own inputs, but you can, of course, use the prefilled examples. It's simple and quick so you can get back to coding what you love.

## Why did we build the playground?
We built our playground because we wanted to give you the ability to test out our most popular features in a sandboxed environment. Whether you are a new developer exploring API authentication for the first time or a seasoned developer who wants to skip the docs and see it in real-time, we have you covered. 
In any case, if you or your company are seeking API authentication, then Unkey is a quick and efficient solution to consider, and the [API Playground](https://play.unkey.com) is a good starting point.

## Conclusion
So jump into our [API Playground](https://play.unkey.com) and mess around. Make some calls and get a feel for how Unkey works. If you are one of the first to complete our playground and sign up for an Unkey account, we will send you some swag! Feel free to jump into our [Discord](https://unkey.com/discord) and ask questions or tell us your thoughts.
