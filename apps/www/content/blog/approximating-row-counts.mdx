Unkey allows users to create an unlimited number of API keys for their applications. Counting these for our dashboard or API has become a growing issue for us.

Most APIs have fewer than a thousand keys, however some of our larger customers have hundreds of thousands. And those customers are also the ones hitting our API the most.


## Schema

```sql

CREATE TABLE `key_space` (
	`id` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
	`workspace_id` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
	# ... omitted
)

CREATE TABLE `keys` (
	`id` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
	`hash` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
	`workspace_id` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
	`key_space_id` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
	# ... omitted
)
```


As you can see, many `keys` belong to a single `key_space` and out query in question is:
```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM keys WHERE key_space_id = ?
```

## Options

We were looking at a few options how to fix this:

1. Caching the count as part of a larger query
2. Caching the `count(*)` query separately in our [tiered cache](https://www.unkey.com/blog/announcing-unkey-cache-package) using SWR semantics.
3. Adding two new columns for storing approximated counts.


## Solution

We went with the 3rd option, mainly because we would never run into a cold cache, where we don't have a value at all, nor does it depend on another component. We can use this in our dashboard just as easily as in our API and it behaves the same.

Adding these two columns, one for storing the approximated count and one for storing a timestamp of when we last updated the count.
```sql
ALTER TABLE `key_space`
  ADD COLUMN `size_approx` int NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  ADD COLUMN `size_last_updated_at` bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'
```

By storing the count on the `key_space` table, we get the count for free cause we're not doing an extra query.
To keep it up to date, we check the `size_last_updated_at` timestamp after every read and if it's too old (60s in our case), we refresh it asynchronously.

Here's how we do it in drizzle:
```ts


const keySpace = await db.query.keySpace.findFirst({where: ...})
if (keySpace.sizeLastUpdatedAt < Date.now() - 60_000) {
  const count = await db
    .select({ count: sql<string>`count(*)` })
    .from(schema.keys)
    .where(and(eq(schema.keys.keySpaceId, keySpace.id), isNull(schema.keys.deletedAt)));

  keySpace.sizeApprox = Number.parseInt(count?.at(0)?.count ?? "0");
  keySpace.sizeLastUpdatedAt = Date.now();

  c.executionCtx.waitUntil(
    db.primary
      .update(schema.keySpace)
      .set({
        sizeApprox: keySpace.sizeApprox,
        sizeLastUpdatedAt: keySpace.sizeLastUpdatedAt,
      })
      .where(eq(schema.keySpace.id, keySpace.id)),
  );
}
```

We first load the `keySpace` and if the data is too old, we kick off a second query to count all keys.
Potentially this might kick off many queries to refresh if a lot of requests come in at the same time, but that's also the case for our current system, where we always count all rows.

In the future we might want to run a cron job to refresh counts in the background and remove the manual refresh, but we haven't needed that yet.
