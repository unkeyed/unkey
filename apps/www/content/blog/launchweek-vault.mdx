**Vault** is our new encryption management service. This service allows you to encrypt and decrypt API keys securely. Unkey only stores a hash of the key so without using the **Vault** there is no way to retrieve a key.  However, The **Vault** gives you the ability to decrypt a key if needed.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypt and decrypt keys. 
- **Key Management:**  Supports multiple keyrings, key rolling and key re-encryption.
- **HTTP API:** Exposes an HTTP API to interact with the service.

## How it works

- Encrypted keys are stored in our main database.
- Encryption keys are encrypted and stored by the **Vault**.
- Only the  **Vault** can decrypt the encryption keys and never hands out encryption keys to the outside world.

This ensures that even if the main database, **Vault** database, or master keys are leaked, they remain safe.

## Why make a Vault?

We created the **Vault** because we wanted to give developers the ability to retrieve keys if they needed too. Due to feedback from our customers, we realized that while it may not be a common feature for everyone. This is a needed feature for some and because of that we are happy to provide a solution. 

## When you shouldn't use Vault

This is an optional feature as it trades a small bit of security for a better user experience. The security risk stems from what the user might do with the key. If you absolutely need to be able to retrieve a key for a user or your own service, then this is the feature you need. If retrieving the key is not so important or the minor security trade-off is too much for your app, then the **Vault** may not be for you and the standard Unkey service will work just fine.

## How to opt in

To opt in to recovery, send us an email at [support@unkey.dev](mailto:support@unkey.dev). Make sure to use the email address associated with your workspace and include the API ID that you want to enable the **Vault** for.
