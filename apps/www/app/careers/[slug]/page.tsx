  const about = `## About Unkey:

Unkey redefines API development, deployment and operations. We provide the infrastructure for developers to ship better code faster. As a rapidly growing startup, we're looking for passionate engineers who want to shape the future of developer infrastructure.

We are a fully remote and mostly asynchronous company, relying on everyone to take ownership of their work and to lead with action.

`;

  const benefits = `## Benefits:

- Stock options/equity.
- Inclusive Healthcare Package.
- Flexible Time Off with a recommended 4 or more weeks per year, and paid holidays.
- Fully remote, work from anywhere globally.
- We provide the gear you need.
`;

  const whyNot = `## Why we may not be a good fit

We're a small, fast-moving startup, and this environment isn't for everyone. You might not enjoy working with us if:
- You prefer well-defined structures and processes. We're building these as we go, and you'll need to be comfortable with ambiguity.
- You're looking for extensive management oversight. We expect everyone to be self-directed and take ownership of their work. When you see something that needs fixing, we expect you to own it end-to-end and drive it to completion.
- You want to focus solely on coding. Building a startup requires wearing multiple hats and contributing beyond your core role.
- You have a big ego. There's no room for "rock stars" who can't take feedback or collaborate.
- You're not comfortable with rapid change. Our priorities and approaches evolve quickly as we learn from our customers.
- You prefer to wait for perfect information before making decisions. We often need to move fast with incomplete data.

We believe in being transparent about our environment and expectations. The right person for this role will be excited by these challenges rather than discouraged by them.
    `;

  const apply = `## How to Apply:
Send us an email at jobs@unkey.dev telling us why you're excited about developer tooling and infrastructure. We'd love to hear about:
- Your perspective on the current state of developer tools
- Any personal pain points you've experienced that motivate you to work in this space
- Relevant projects or systems you've built that align with our mission
- Your GitHub profile (if you have public work you'd like to share)

We value thoughtful, genuine responses over formal applications. The best candidates are those who are genuinely passionate about empowering developers.
