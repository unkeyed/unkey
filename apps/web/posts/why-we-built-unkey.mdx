## What is Unkey?

Unkey provides a way for you to create, manage and revoke API Keys that belong to your API. It's a simple concept, but one that we think is important.  We built Unkey to layer it into your API so that you can issue keys, manage them and revoke them as needed. We've built it to be as simple as possible to integrate into your API. We've also built and easy to use dashboard so that if you want to manually issue keys you can do so.

## Why did we build it?

We built Unkey because we were tired of copy and pasting the same API management into a new codebase. We also wanted to create a way to handle short term keys, rate limited keys and ways to add metadata to them for easy autorization. We also wanted a way for our customers to see usage stats, and invite other users to their account.

## What are the current features?

Unkey provides the following features out of the box:

- A admin dashboard to manage your APIs, issue keys, revoke keys and see usage stats.
- A simple API with SDKs for typescript
- Short lived keys 
- Rate limited keys
- Metadata attached to keys

## Deep dive into the features

### Admin dashboard

Our admin dashboard gives you access to a number of features in a simple to use interface. You can create new APIs, issue keys, revoke keys and see usage stats. You can also invite other users to your account so that they can manage your APIs.

### Simple API with SDKs

We wanted the DX for Unkey to be as simple as possible. We've built a simple API that you can use to create, manage and revoke keys. We've also built SDKs for typescript so that you can easily integrate Unkey into your API. Our community SDKs included Python and Elixir.

### Short lived keys

When we started Unkey we wanted the ability to issue a short lived key but we didn't want to restrict the time period. We wanted to give you the ability to issue a key for 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week or 5 years.

### Rate limited keys

Rate limiting is essential to all businesses that have an API. Unkey gives you the ability to set each key to a different rate limit. This means if you have a large customer you can give them a higher rate limit than your free tier customers.

### Metadata attached to keys

We wanted to give you the ability to attach metadata to your keys so you can easily make business decsions based on the data instead of having to look up the key in your database.
