            We are globally remote and were founded that way too. We believe that the best talent is
            not always in the same place and that we can build a better product by hiring the best
            talent, no matter where they are.

            We are serial builders who love to innovate. We are always looking for new ways to
            improve our product and our community. If we aren&apos;t working on Unkey, we are
            probably learning about something new.

            Unkey is a fully open source project, we believe that open source leads to better
            products and better communities. We are committed to building a great open source
