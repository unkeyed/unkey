I have always been farily opininated about marketing and how it doesn't work for developer tools. Similarly I believe that 95% of companies doing developer relations are doing it wrong, and most of it comes down to the following:

> I saw X company doing it and they were successful. I did the same and it didn't work

The reason you see company X succeeding is because when they started doing whatever marketing strategy the world was different. If you are start up trying to gain traction you are looking at marketing from an enterprise perspective. Let's talk about how Unkey does marketing and why it spills a little into developer relations. 

## TLDR

### Free

For YouTube:

- People won't subscribe to a business channel so use a personal channel if you have one.
- If you do want a business channel, expect that the views to subscriber ratio to be weird.
- Content of any form is good content (short form, long form, livestreaming)

Streaming:

- If you are new. Find people in the industry to stream on their channel as a guest.
- Stream on all platforms you can (YT, Twitch) to begin with, to find the platform that works for you and potential audience.
- Expect that streaming will produce poor results in the beginning (discovery is terrible). If you don't see any growth after 3-6 months just stop (it's not a medium that works for you)

Tweeting:

- Tweet from your personal account tag your business account.
- Have fun on the business account (memes, GIFs etc)
- Tweet from the business account when you have a following of 1k but only impactful stuff.

### If you have money to spend

- Influencers are your friend
- Find five "influencers" in the niche, build a relationship with them, then once you have a relationship you can work together. They should be champions of your product not just you paying them.
- Sponsor community projects
- Sponsor newsletters that are in your space
- YT videos that are sponsored. The outcome is not the "views", the outcome is if someone searches for you you aren't the only people talking about it. Even people with 2k subscribers have more reach than you do for the most part.

### Product lead growth

Three key places to talk to a customer

- Onboarding (send an email when they sign up offering up a way to get in touch)
- Users who are using the product consistently
- Offboarding (Why you leaving)


## YouTube & Streaming

YouTube has unlimited marketing potential, it's the reason that influencers in 2023 are making products. If you look at the space now you have influencers in industries you'd never imagine 20 years go, let's just look at Logan Paul and KSI both have huge followings across almost all platforms but mostly YouTube. They now both have:

- Boxing careers
- A multi billion dollar drink company
- Music careers
- Alchoal brand, food brands

Prime spends almost zero dollars on marketing, because they have free marketing from two influences. Which means they can then spend money on sponsoring huge sporting clubs or athletes to move the brand forward. Their product isn't actually any good in terms of what it is for, but their marketing train is incredible. What does this have to do with developer tools I hear you ask!

> YouTube is free marketing with unlimited potential. 


### Personal Channels vs Business Channels

Open your YouTube subscriber feed, how many companies are you subscribed too? The answer is probably close to zero if not zero and this is where the problem for a new company starts. How do you market if people don't subscribe to your channel?

#### Personal Channel

If you have a personal channel, you can back into your channel... Assuming that one it falls into your niche and you believe your audience can roll with the content from your company. If you don't have a personal channel, the next question is "Do you have time"? Right now the answer will be yes, you are a scrappy startup you can make time. YouTube is a garden, it needs a lot of work to be successful.. If you are interested in content creation then go for it. Otherwise maybe a business channel is for you but I still believe personal channels rule. 


#### Business Channel

So you want a channel that only deals with X company and things related to X company? Great! Let me break down what you'd expect from having a business channel:

- People aren't going to subscribe as easily as a personal channel
- The content needs to be focused, and for things people search for. 
- Build for search in a smart way. 

If you devtool is "API Authentication", please don't make a "Getting started with API Authentication video", your docs already cover this. Make videos that focus on aspects of integrating your product somewhere, "How to secure Supabbase functions using X" is something some will search for. 


#### Content

All content forms are good content forms as long as you put the effort in: 

- YT Shorts / TikToks 
- YT longer form (3-20 mins)
- YT Crash courses (30+ mins)
- Livestreaming 

All of these are searchable, all of this provide reusuable content and all of them can be embedded in the future. 

### Streaming

So you want to stream? Don't. I'd say almost every company who tries streaming gives up, because a streamer is a very special kind of person. The amount of time that goes into sitting in front of an audience or no audience for hours at a time is difficult. If you decide you are up for a challenge:


- Start by testing the water with people who already stream and have guests.
- A personal channel is best
- Expect traction to be slow
- Give up at 3-5 months if you aren't seeing growth... Your efforts are better else where.
