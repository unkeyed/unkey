title: Securing environments using Unkey
description: Creating keys for a specific environment allows you to segment test and production data without additional logic in your code.

In the market today, we see a lot of products offering different environments. This is done for several reasons, including segmenting testing from production data, offering different rate limits for APIs, and allowing users to match environments to their infrastructure.

We provide a way to create keys to specific environments, and all of our features, like ratelimiting, allow you to develop your application with X.

## Creating environment-specific keys

To make environment-specific keys, you can pass the `environment` value as part of your creation method. For example:

```bash
curl -XPOST 'https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <UNKEY_ROOT_KEY>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "<UNKEY_API_ID>",
    "environment": "test"
  }'
```

This will return a key specific to the test environment, however we would advise making sure you use our prefix feature to make it easier to identify for your users. The most popular prefix in the industry made popular by Stripe is `sk_test` and `sk_live` .

```bash
curl -XPOST 'https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <UNKEY_ROOT_KEY>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "<UNKEY_API_ID>",
    "environment": "test",
    "prefix": "sk_test"
  }'
```

## Verifying keys

With the creation of environment-specific keys, we need to ensure that you can verify which environment the key was created for. When you request our verification endpoint, we will return the environment as part of the response. For example:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.verifyKey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "apiId": "<UNKEY_API_ID",
    "key": "sk_test_1234"
  }'
```

Our response will look similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "keyId": "key_2P4KnnCa2zD4Z7vBpgWU6z5NerX9",
  "valid": true,
  "enabled": true,
  "permissions": [],
  "environment": "test"
}
```

With this response, you can then drive audit logging or even application decisions about the environment being used.
