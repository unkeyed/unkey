## A brand new onboarding experience

When you sign up for an Unkey account you now get a new onboarding experience. We take you through creating a workspace, API and showing how Unkey works before you land in the dashboard.

## Dashboard improvements

We fixed a number of bugs and also improved the dashboard experience here are a list of them:

1. Adding meta to a key is now automatically formatted on blur to make it easy to read
2. The caching issues have been resolved, so creating, updating or removing any data will be reflected correctly. 
3. Adds Remaining feature to the UI to allow you to create limited usage keys in a single click.

****************************Error messages built to inform****************************

Have you ever worked with a third party lib, and you received an “Oops try again” error or an extremely vague error that gives you zero indication of what caused it? Great news! Unkey’s error response provide everything you could need to rectify the problem. Every error response will return:

An error code, a link to the documentation, an informative message, and a requestId that you can provide to Unkey support to track down.

## SDK improvements

Our typescript package `@unkey/api` got two upgrades this week, to make it even faster to integrate Unkey into your project.

### Verify Key

You can now verify a key and make business decisions in just a few lines of code. Below is an example:

```tsx
import { verifyKey } from "@unkey/api" 

const { result, error } = await verifyKey("key_123")

if (error){
  console.error(error.message)
  return
}

if (!result.valid) {
  // Key isn't valid so don't allow access to resource
  return
}

// process request
console.log(result)
```

### Automatic Retries

Our SDK will now automatically retry 5 times with a backoff to smooth over network issues, you can of course override the retry and backoff. Below is an example of 10 retries with a backoff

```tsx
import { Unkey } from "@unkey/api";

const unkey = new Unkey({
  token: "<UNKEY_TOKEN>",
  retry: {
    attempts: 10,
    backoff: (previousAttempts) => previousAttempts * 1000, // 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s etc
  }
});
```
