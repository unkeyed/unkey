description: Overwrite the roles of a key with a new set of roles.
---

Sets the roles of a key to a new set of roles. This endpoint overwrites the existing roles of the key with the new set.
Existing roles that are not included in the new set are removed.

You can provide either role ids or role names in the request body. If you provide a name, we will create the role if it does not exist.


<Note>
To use this endpoint, your root key must have the `rbac.*.add_role_to_key` and potentially the `rbac.*.create_role` permissions.
