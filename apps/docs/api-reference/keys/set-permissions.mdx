description: Overwrite the permissions of a key with a new set of permissions.
---

Sets the permissions of a key to a new set of permissions. This endpoint overwrites the existing permissions of the key with the new set.
Existing permissions that are not included in the new set are removed.

You can provide either permission ids or permission names in the request body. If you provide a name, we will create the permission if it does not exist.

<Note>
To use this endpoint, your root key must have the `rbac.*.add_permission_to_key` and potentially the `rbac.*.create_permission` permissions.
