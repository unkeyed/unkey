## Request

<ParamField body="apiId" type="string" required>
  Choose an `API` where this key should be created.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="prefix" type="string" >
To make it easier for your users to understand which product an api key belongs to, you can add prefix them.

For example Stripe famously prefixes their customer ids with `cus_` or their api keys with `sk_live_`.

The underscore is automatically added if you are defining a prefix, for example: `"prefix": "abc"` will result in a key like `abc_xxxxxxxxx`

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="name" type="string">
  To make it easier to identify a particular key, you can provide a name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="byteLength" type="int" default={16} >
The byte length used to generate your key determines its entropy as well as its length.
Higher is better, but keys become longer and more annoying to handle.

The default is `16 bytes`, or 2<sup>128</sup> possible combinations

 </ParamField>

 <ParamField body="ownerId" type="string" >
  Your user's Id. This will provide a link between Unkey and your customer record.

When validating a key, we will return this back to you, so you can clearly identify your user from their api key.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="meta" type="object" >
This is a place for dynamic meta data, anything that feels useful for you should go here

Example:

```json
{
  "billingTier": "PRO",
  "trialEnds": "2023-06-16T17:16:37.161Z"
}
```

</ParamField>
<ParamField body="expires" type="int" >
  You can auto expire keys by providing a unix timestamp in milliseconds.

Once keys expire they will automatically be deleted and are no longer valid.

</ParamField>

 <ParamField body="remaining" type="int" >
  Optionally limit the number of times a key can be used. This is different from time-based expiration using `expires`.

Example:

```json
"remaining": 10
```

The created key can be verified successfully 10 times, afterwards it is invalidated automatically.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="ratelimit" type="Object" >

Unkey comes with per-key ratelimiting out of the box.

  <Expandable title="properties">

  <ParamField body="type" type="string" default="fast" required>
  Either `fast` or `consistent`.

Read more [here](/features/ratelimiting)

  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="limit" type="int" required>
  The total amount of burstable requests.

  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="refillRate" type="int" required>
  How many tokens to refill during each `refillInterval`
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="refillInterval" type="int" required>
  Determines the speed at which tokens are refilled.

In milliseconds

  </ParamField>
 </Expandable>
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="key" type="string" required>
  The newly created api key, do not store this on your own system but pass it along to your user.

Use this to authorize a user, for details see [here](/api-reference/keys/verify)

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="keyId" type="string" required>
  A unique id to reference this key for updating or revoking. This id can not be
  used to verify the key.
</ResponseField>
