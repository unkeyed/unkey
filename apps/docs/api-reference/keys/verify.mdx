api: "POST /v1/keys/verify"
---

Verify a key from your users. Notice how this endpoint does not require an Unkey api key. You only need to send the api key from your user.

## Request

<ParamField body="key" type="string" required>
  The key you want to verify.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="apiId" type="string">
  The api this key belongs to. This will be required soon.
</ParamField>


## Response

<ResponseField name="valid" type="boolean" required>
  Whether or not this key is valid and has passed the ratelimit. If `false` you
  should not grant access to whatever the user is requesting
</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="code" type="string" >
  If the key is invalid this field will be set to the reason why it is invalid.

  Possible values are:
  - `NOT_FOUND` - The key does not exist
  - `FORBIDDEN` - You are not allowed to verify this key. For example because of additional security
  checks like `IP whitelists`
  - `KEY_USAGE_EXCEEDED` - The key has been used up and is no longer valid
  - `RATELIMITED` - The verification has been blocked due to ratelimiting
</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="ownerId" type="string">
  If you have set an `ownerId` on this key it is returned here. You can use this
  to clearly authenticate a user in your system.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expires" type="int">
  The unix timestamp in milliseconds indicating when this key expires.
</ResponseField>

  "billingTier": "PRO",
  "trialEnds": "2023-06-16T17:16:37.161Z"
