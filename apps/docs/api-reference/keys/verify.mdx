## Request

<ParamField body="key" type="string" required>
The key you want to verify.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="valid" type="boolean" required>
  Whether or not this key is valid and has passed the ratelimit.
  If `false` you should not grant access to whatever the user is requesting
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="ownerId" type="string">
  If you have set an `ownerId` on this key it is returned here. You can use this to clearly authenticate a user in your system.
</ResponseField>


<ResponseField name="meta" type="object" >
This is the `meta` data you have set when creating the key.

}
```

</ResponseField>
