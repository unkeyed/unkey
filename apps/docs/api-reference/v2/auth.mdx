description: 'Securely authenticating with the Unkey API'
---


Almost all Unkey API endpoints require authentication using a root key. Root keys provide access to your Unkey resources based on their assigned permissions.

## Bearer Authentication

Authentication is performed using HTTP Bearer authentication in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer unkey_1234567890
```

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.createKey" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "apiId": "api_1234" }'
```

## Security Best Practices

Never expose your root key in client-side code or include it in public repositories. For frontend applications, always use a backend server to proxy requests to the Unkey API.

## Root Key Management

Root keys can be created and managed through the Unkey dashboard. We recommend:

1. **Using Different Keys for Different Environments**: Maintain separate root keys for development, staging, and production
2. **Rotating Keys Regularly**: Create new keys periodically and phase out old ones
3. **Setting Clear Key Names**: Name your keys according to their use case for better manageability

## Key Permissions System

Unkey implements a sophisticated RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system for root keys. Permissions are defined as tuples of:

- **ResourceType**: The category of resource (api, ratelimit, rbac, identity)
- **ResourceID**: The specific resource instance
- **Action**: The operation to perform on that resource

### Available Resource Types

| Resource Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `api` | API-related resources, such as endpoints and keys |
| `ratelimit` | Rate limiting resources and configuration |
| `rbac` | Permissions and roles management |
| `identity` | User and identity management |

### Permission Examples

Specific permission to manage a single API:
```
api.api_1234.read_api
api.api_1234.update_api
```

Wildcard permission to manage all rate limit namespaces:
```
ratelimit.*.create_namespace
ratelimit.*.read_namespace
```

When creating root keys, you can specify exactly what actions they're allowed to perform.

## Authentication Errors

If your authentication fails, you'll receive a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden response with an error message:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "req_abc123xyz789"
  },
  "error": {
    "title": "Unauthorized",
    "detail": "The provided root key is invalid or has been revoked",
    "status": 401,
    "type": "https://unkey.com/docs/errors/unauthorized"
  }
}
```

If your key is valid but lacks sufficient permissions, you'll receive a 403 Forbidden response:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "req_abc123xyz789"
  },
  "error": {
    "title": "Forbidden",
    "detail": "Your key does not have the required 'api.api_1234.update_api' permission",
    "status": 403,
    "type": "https://unkey.com/docs/errors/forbidden"
  }
}
```

Common authentication issues include:
- Missing the Authorization header
- Invalid key format
- Revoked or expired root key
- Using a key with insufficient permissions
