title: Create an identity
openapi: post /v1/identities.createIdentity

<Info>
 Identities are in public beta. Please report any issues to [support@unkey.dev](mailto:support@unkey.dev)
</Info>

Create a new identity in the system. This might not be necessary as newly created keys automatically create an identity if required.

Identities map your users, organisations or other entities to keys. They can be used to share metadata and limits.
