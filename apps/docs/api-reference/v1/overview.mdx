<Warning>The v1 API is deprecated and will be removed in January 2026. Please [migrate to the v2 API](/api-reference/v1/migration).</Warning>

<Danger>
**Root Key Permissions Required for v2 Key Verification**

If you are migrating to the v2 API, you **must** update your root key to include the `api.*.verify_key` permission (or a specific `api.<API_ID>.verify_key` permission) to verify keys. Without this permission, your key verification requests will fail.

</Danger>

The Unkey API uses HTTP RPC-style methods and generally follow the schema:

```
https://api.unkey.dev/{version}/{service}.{method}
```

For example `GET https://api.unkey.dev/v1/apis.listKeys` to list all keys for an API.

## HTTP Methods

We strictly use only `GET` and `POST` methods. `PUT` and `DELETE` are not used.

### `GET`

`GET` methods are used for reading data. Filtering, sorting, or pagination is done via query parameters.

```http
curl "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.getKey?keyId=key_123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ROOT_KEY>"
```


### `POST`

`POST` methods are used for creating, updating, and deleting data. Data is passed as `application/json` in the request body.

```http
curl -XPOST "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ROOT_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"apiId": "api_123", "name": "My Key"}'
```
