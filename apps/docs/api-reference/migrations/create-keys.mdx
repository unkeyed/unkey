title: Migrate key to Unkey
openapi: post /v1/migrations.createKeys
---

Add existing keys to unkey by specifying the key hash and other settings.

This endpoint supports bulk inserts of up to 100 keys at a time. If you have more keys, you can call this endpoint multiple times.
If any operation fails (e.g., due to a duplicate key), everything will be rolled back and no keys are created.
