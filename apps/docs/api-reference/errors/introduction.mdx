The Unkey API returns machine readable error codes to quickly identify the type of error as well as link to the docs and a `requestId`. Please always include the `requestId` in your error report.

```json JSON response
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "docs": "https://unkey.dev/docs/api-reference/errors/code/NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "unable to find workspace ws_123",
    "requestId": "fra:fra::e4bcaf2b91ce0296c31f44e8e4cc70a9"
  }
}
```

If you can't debug something on your own or think there is a bug, please get in touch with us on [Discord](https://unkey.dev/discord) or [Email](mailto:andreas@unkey.dev) and provide the full error response.
