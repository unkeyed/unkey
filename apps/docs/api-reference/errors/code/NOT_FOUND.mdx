title: NOT_FOUND
openapi-schema: ErrNotFound
---

## Overview
The NOT_FOUND error (HTTP 404) occurs when the requested resource does not exist in the system. This could be because it was deleted, never existed, or you don't have access to it.

## Common Causes
- Using an incorrect or non-existent resource ID
- Attempting to access a key that has been deleted
- Referencing an API that doesn't exist in your workspace
- Using the wrong workspace ID
- Trying to access a resource that belongs to a different account
- Resource was recently deleted by another user or process

## Resolution Steps
1. **Verify the resource ID**: Double-check that you're using the correct ID for the resource you're trying to access.

2. **Check if the resource exists**: Use a GET request to check if the resource exists before trying to modify it:
   ```bash
   # Example: Check if a key exists
   curl -X GET "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys/{keyId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
   ```

3. **Verify your workspace**: Ensure you're operating in the correct workspace where the resource should exist.

4. **Check access permissions**: Confirm you have permission to access the resource.

5. **Create the resource**: If you're certain the resource should not exist yet, use the appropriate creation endpoint.
