title: EXPIRED
openapi-schema: ErrExpired
---

## Overview
The EXPIRED error (HTTP 403) occurs when you attempt to use a key that has passed its expiration date. Expired keys cannot be used for authentication or API operations.

## Common Causes
- Using a key that was created with a short expiration time
- Attempting to use a temporary key after its lifetime has ended
- The key's expiration date was set and has now passed
- Trying to verify an expired key
- Using keys that were automatically expired due to security policies

## Resolution Steps
1. **Check expiration status**: Verify the key's expiration status:
   ```bash
   # Example: Check a key's details including expiration
   curl -X GET "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys/{keyId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
   ```

2. **Update the key's expiration**: If you have appropriate permissions, extend the key's expiration:
   ```bash
   # Example: Update a key to extend or remove expiration
   curl -X PATCH "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys/{keyId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "expires": 1672531200000  # Set to a future timestamp (milliseconds since epoch)
       # Or remove expiration with "expires": null
     }'
   ```

3. **Create a new key**: If you can't update the expired key, create a new one:
   ```bash
   # Example: Create a new key to replace the expired one
   curl -X POST "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "apiId": "api_123",
       "expires": 1672531200000  # Optional: Set a future expiration date
     }'
   ```

4. **Implement key rotation**: Consider implementing key rotation before expiration to avoid disruption.
