title: METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED
openapi-schema: ErrMethodNotAllowed
---

## Overview
The METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED error (HTTP 405) occurs when you attempt to use an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that is not supported by the endpoint you're trying to access.

## Common Causes
- Using POST on an endpoint that only accepts GET requests
- Using DELETE on a resource that doesn't support deletion
- Using PUT or PATCH on an endpoint that doesn't support updates
- Attempting to use OPTIONS or HEAD methods on endpoints that don't implement them
- Misconfigured API client or incorrect API documentation reference

## Resolution Steps
1. **Verify the correct HTTP method**: Check the API documentation to confirm which HTTP methods are supported for the endpoint you're trying to access.

2. **Check your API client configuration**: Ensure your API client or code is using the correct HTTP method for the operation you want to perform.

3. **Use the correct endpoint**: Different operations often require different endpoints, even for the same resource type:
   ```
   # Creating a resource (POST)
   POST /v1/keys
   
   # Retrieving a resource (GET)
   GET /v1/keys/{keyId}
   
   # Updating a resource (PATCH/PUT)
   PATCH /v1/keys/{keyId}
   
   # Deleting a resource (DELETE)
   DELETE /v1/keys/{keyId}
   ```

4. **Check for typos in your request**: Make sure you're not accidentally sending a request to the wrong URL with the wrong method.
