title: NOT_UNIQUE
---

```json JSON response
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_UNIQUE",
    "message": "what happened"
    ...
  }
}
```

## Problem

Another resource already uses this identifier. For example workspace slugs must be unique globally.

## Solution

Please choose a different name/identifier.
