title: CONFLICT
openapi-schema: ErrConflict
---

## Overview
The CONFLICT error (HTTP 409) occurs when your request conflicts with the current state of the target resource. This typically happens when you're trying to create or update a resource with an identifier that's already in use by another resource.

## Common Causes
- Creating a resource with a name that's already taken
- Using a workspace slug that already exists
- Creating a permission with an identifier that's already in use
- Attempting to create a unique constraint that would be violated
- Creating a key with a custom ID that already exists
- Concurrent updates to the same resource

## Resolution Steps
1. **Choose a different identifier**: Select a unique name, ID, or slug for your resource.

2. **Check existing resources**: List your existing resources to see what names are already in use:
   ```bash
   # Example: List existing APIs to check name availability
   curl -X GET "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/apis" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
   ```

3. **Use update instead of create**: If you're trying to modify an existing resource, use the appropriate update endpoint instead of creating a new one.

4. **Let Unkey generate IDs**: When possible, allow Unkey to generate unique IDs automatically rather than specifying custom identifiers.

5. **Add uniqueness check**: Consider checking if a resource exists before trying to create it:
   ```bash
   # Example: Check if an API exists before creating it
   curl -X GET "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/apis/{apiName}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
   ```
