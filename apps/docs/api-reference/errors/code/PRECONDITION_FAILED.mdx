title: PRECONDITION_FAILED
openapi-schema: ErrPreconditionFailed
---

## Overview
The PRECONDITION_FAILED error (HTTP 412) occurs when your request doesn't satisfy one or more required conditions. This typically happens when there's a mismatch between the expected state of a resource and its actual state.

## Common Causes
- Attempting to use a feature that requires beta access
- Using an API version that doesn't match the expected version header
- Modifying a resource that has been updated by another process
- Conditional requests with If-Match or If-None-Match headers that aren't satisfied
- Attempting operations that require specific feature flags to be enabled
- Resources in a state that doesn't allow the requested operation

## Resolution Steps
1. **Check feature access**: Verify if you have access to the feature you're trying to use, especially for beta features:
   ```bash
   # Example: Check workspace features
   curl -X GET "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
   ```

2. **Review version requirements**: Check if you're using the correct API version for the operation.

3. **Verify resource state**: Ensure the resource is in the expected state before trying the operation again:
   ```bash
   # Example: Check resource state
   curl -X GET "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/{resource_type}/{id}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
   ```

4. **Request feature access**: Contact Unkey support if you need access to a feature that's currently restricted.

5. **Update client code**: Ensure your application is using the most recent API client and following current best practices.
