## Problem

We were unable to authorize your request. Either your key was missing, malformed or does not have the required permissions.

## Solution

Check the `message` field and double check you are sending the key correctly in the `Authorization` header.

If that doesn't help, ask for help on [Discord](https://unkey.dev/discord)
