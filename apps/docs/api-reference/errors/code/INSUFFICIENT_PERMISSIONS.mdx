title: INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS
openapi-schema: ErrInsufficientPermissions
---

## Overview
The INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS error (HTTP 403) occurs when your API key doesn't have the specific permissions required to perform the requested action. Unlike the broader FORBIDDEN error, this error specifically indicates a permissions problem with your API key.

## Common Causes
- Using a key with limited permission scope
- Attempting to perform actions requiring specific permissions your key doesn't have
- Using a key from a role with restricted access
- Trying to access resources that require elevated permissions
- Working with newly created keys that haven't been granted all necessary permissions

## Resolution Steps
1. **Check your key permissions**: Review the current permissions assigned to your key:
   ```bash
   # Example: Check your key's permissions
   curl -X GET "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys/{keyId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_root_key"
   ```

2. **Add required permissions**: Add the required permissions to your key in the [Unkey Dashboard](https://app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys).

3. **Use a different key**: If you have access to a key with higher privileges, use that instead.

4. **Request permission elevation**: Contact your workspace administrator to request additional permissions for your role or key.

5. **Create a new key with proper permissions**: If you're authorized to do so, create a new key with all required permissions:
   ```bash
   # Example: Create a new key with specific permissions
   curl -X POST "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_root_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "apiId": "api_123",
       "permissions": ["apis.create", "keys.create", "keys.update"]
     }'
   ```
