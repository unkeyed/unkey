## Overview
The INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (HTTP 500) indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This is a generic server-side error that could be caused by various issues within our systems.

## Common Causes
- Unexpected server-side exceptions
- Temporary infrastructure issues
- Database connectivity problems
- Resource limitations on our servers
- Service dependencies that are temporarily unavailable
- Bugs in our implementation that we haven't caught yet

## Resolution Steps
1. **Check service status**: Visit our [status page](https://status.unkey.dev) to see if there are any ongoing incidents.

3. **Provide error details**: When reporting the issue, always include:
   - The full error response
   - The request ID (`requestId` field in the error response)
   - The approximate time when the error occurred
