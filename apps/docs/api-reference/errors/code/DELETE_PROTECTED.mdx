title: DELETE_PROTECTED
openapi-schema: ErrDeleteProtected
---

## Overview
The DELETE_PROTECTED error (HTTP 412) occurs when you attempt to delete a resource that has been specifically marked as protected from deletion. This protection mechanism prevents accidental deletion of important resources.

## Common Causes
- Attempting to delete an API that has been marked as protected
- Trying to delete a workspace that contains protected resources
- Deleting a key that has been flagged as critical
- Attempting to remove resources that are essential for system operations
- Trying to delete resources marked as protected for compliance or security reasons

## Resolution Steps
1. **Check protection status**: Verify if the resource is indeed protected:
   ```bash
   # Example: Check API details including protection status
   curl -X GET "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/apis/{apiId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
   ```

2. **Remove protection**: If appropriate, remove the deletion protection using the dashboard:
   - Navigate to the [Unkey Dashboard](https://app.unkey.com)
   - Find the resource you want to delete
   - Go to its settings and disable the deletion protection

3. **Update via API**: For some resources, you can update the protection status via API:
   ```bash
   # Example: Remove deletion protection from an API
   curl -X PATCH "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/apis/{apiId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "deleteProtection": false
     }'
   ```

4. **Contact administrator**: If you don't have permission to modify protection settings, contact your workspace administrator.

5. **Consider alternatives**: Instead of deleting, consider disabling or archiving the resource if those options are available.
