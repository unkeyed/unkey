title: DISABLED
openapi-schema: ErrDisabled

## Overview
The DISABLED error (HTTP 403) occurs when you attempt to use or modify a key that has been explicitly disabled in the system. Disabled keys cannot be used for authentication or API operations until re-enabled.

## Common Causes
- Using a key that was disabled by an administrator
- Attempting to verify a key that has been temporarily suspended
- The workspace associated with the key has been disabled
- The key was automatically disabled due to suspicious activity
- The key was disabled due to billing issues
- Trying to use a disabled key for authentication

## Resolution Steps
1. **Enable the key**: If you have appropriate permissions, enable the key using the update endpoint:
   ```bash
   # Example: Enable a disabled key
   curl -X PATCH "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys/{keyId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "enabled": true
     }'
   ```

2. **Use the dashboard**: Enable the key using the [Unkey Dashboard](https://app.unkey.com).

3. **Check workspace status**: Ensure the workspace associated with the key is active and in good standing.

4. **Create a new key**: If you can't enable the current key, consider creating a new one:
   ```bash
   # Example: Create a new key to replace the disabled one
   curl -X POST "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "apiId": "api_123",
       "enabled": true
     }'
   ```

5. **Contact administrator**: If you don't have permission to enable keys, contact your workspace administrator.
