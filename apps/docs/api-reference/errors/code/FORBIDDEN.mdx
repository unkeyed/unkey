title: FORBIDDEN
openapi-schema: ErrForbidden
---

## Overview
The FORBIDDEN error (HTTP 403) occurs when you have been successfully authenticated, but your authenticated user or API key does not have sufficient permissions to perform the requested action on the specified resource.

## Common Causes
- Using an API key with insufficient permissions
- Trying to access resources owned by a different workspace
- Attempting to perform an action restricted to specific user roles
- Accessing a resource that requires additional permissions
- Working with resources in a workspace where your access has been restricted
- Attempting to modify system-protected resources

## Resolution Steps
1. **Check key permissions**: Verify that your API key has the necessary permissions for the operation:
   ```bash
   # Example: View your key's permissions
   curl -X GET "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys/{keyId}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
   ```

2. **Use a different key**: If possible, use a key with higher privileges or request additional permissions.

3. **Verify workspace access**: Ensure you're using a key that belongs to the correct workspace for the resource you're trying to access.

4. **Check role requirements**: Some actions may be limited to specific user roles (e.g., admin, owner).

5. **Request additional permissions**: Contact your workspace administrator to request additional permissions if needed.
