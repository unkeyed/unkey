title: INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS
openapi-schema: ErrInsufficientPermissions

## Problem

You do not have permission to perform this action. In most cases this means the root key you are using, is lacking permissions.

## Solution

Go to the [Unkey Dashboard](https://app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys) and add the required permissions to your key.
