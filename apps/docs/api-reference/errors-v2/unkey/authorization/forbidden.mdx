  }
}
```

## What Happened?

This error occurs when you attempt an operation that is prohibited by Unkey's platform policies, even if your API key has high-level permissions. Unlike the "insufficient_permissions" error which relates to permission roles, this error indicates that the operation itself is not allowed regardless of permissions.

Common scenarios that trigger this error:
- Trying to perform operations on protected or system resources
- Attempting to modify resources that are in a state that doesn't allow modifications
- Trying to exceed account limits or quotas
- Performing operations that violate platform policies

Here's an example of a request that might trigger this error:

```bash
# Attempting to delete a protected system resource
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/apis.deleteApi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "api_system_protected"
  }'
```

## How To Fix

This error indicates a fundamental restriction rather than a permission issue. The operation you're trying to perform may be:

1. **Not supported by the Unkey platform**: Some operations are simply not available
2. **Blocked due to your account's current state or limitations**: Your account may not have access to certain features
3. **Prevented by safety mechanisms**: System protections may prevent certain destructive operations

Possible solutions include:

- **Check Unkey's documentation**: Understand which operations have fundamental restrictions
- **Consider your account state**: Some operations may be blocked due to your account state or plan
- **Use alternative approaches**: Find supported ways to accomplish similar goals
- **If you're trying to modify a resource in a specific state**, check if it needs to be in a different state first
- **If you're hitting account limits**, consider upgrading your plan
- **Contact Unkey support** if you believe this restriction shouldn't apply to your use case

## Common Mistakes

- **Attempting to modify system resources**: Some Unkey resources are protected and cannot be modified
- **Order-dependent operations**: Trying to perform operations out of their required sequence
- **Plan limitations**: Attempting operations not available on your current plan
- **Resource state issues**: Trying to modify resources that are in a state that doesn't allow changes
- **Ignoring documentation warnings**: Not reading warnings about restricted operations
- **Testing security boundaries**: Deliberately trying to access protected resources
- **Outdated documentation**: Following outdated documentation that suggests now-forbidden operations
