    "detail": "The requested rate limit namespace could not be found",
    "status": 404,

  }
}
```

## What Happened?

This error occurs when you're trying to perform an operation on a rate limit namespace that doesn't exist in the Unkey system. Rate limit namespaces are used to organize and manage rate limits for different resources or operations.

Common scenarios that trigger this error:
- Using an incorrect namespace ID or name
- Referencing a namespace that has been deleted
- Trying to modify a namespace that doesn't exist in the current workspace
- Typos in namespace names when using name-based lookups

Here's an example of a request that would trigger this error:

```bash
# Attempting to get overrides for a non-existent namespace
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/ratelimit.listOverrides \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "namespaceName": "nonexistent_namespace"
  }'
```

## How To Fix

Verify that you're using the correct namespace ID or name and that the namespace still exists in your workspace:

1. Check the namespace ID or name in your request for typos or formatting errors
2. List all namespaces in your workspace to find the correct ID or name
3. If the namespace has been deleted, you may need to recreate it

Here's how to use the correct namespace in a rate limit operation:

```bash
# Creating a rate limit using a valid namespace
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/ratelimit.limit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "namespace": "your_valid_namespace",
    "identifier": "user_123",
    "limit": 100,
    "duration": 60000
  }'
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Typos in namespace names**: Small typographical errors in namespace names
- **Case sensitivity**: Namespace names might be case-sensitive
- **Deleted namespaces**: Referencing namespaces that have been removed
- **Workspace boundaries**: Trying to use namespaces from another workspace
