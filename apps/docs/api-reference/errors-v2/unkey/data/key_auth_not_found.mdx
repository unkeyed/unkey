}
```

## What Happened?

This error occurs when you're trying to perform an operation on a key authentication record that doesn't exist in the Unkey system. Key authentication records contain information about how API keys are authenticated.

Common scenarios that trigger this error:
- Using an incorrect key authentication ID
- Referencing a key authentication record that has been deleted
- Attempting to update authentication settings for a non-existent record
- Typos in identifiers

Here's an example of a request that might trigger this error:

```bash
# Attempting to update a non-existent key authentication record
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v1/keys.updateKeyAuth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "keyAuthId": "kauth_nonexistent",
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

## How To Fix

Verify that you're using the correct key authentication ID and that the record still exists:

1. Check the key authentication ID in your request for typos or formatting errors
2. Verify the key authentication record exists by looking up the associated key
3. If the record has been deleted, you may need to recreate the key or its authentication settings

Here's how to get information about a key's authentication settings:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v1/keys.getKey \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "keyId": "key_your_key_id"
  }'
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Copy-paste errors**: Incorrect IDs due to copy-paste mistakes
- **Deleted records**: Attempting to reference authentication records for deleted keys
- **Misunderstanding relationships**: Confusing key IDs with key authentication IDs
- **Workspace boundaries**: Trying to access authentication records from another workspace
