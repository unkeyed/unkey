title: Usage limited keys
description: 'Limiting the usage of keys'

Sometimes you would like to create an api key and automatically invalidate it after a certain number of uses.

Example:
You are selling API access and a customer has purchased 1000 api requests from you.

Unkey allows you to set/update usage limits on individual keys and we take care of invalidating a key after it has reached its limit.





### Example

Let's create a new key, which can be used 100 times.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <UNKEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"apiId":"<API_ID>",
	"remaining": 100
}'
```

Now when you verify the new key, you will receive back the remaining verifications and after all of them are used up, the key is invalid.


```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.verifyKey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
      "apiId":"<API_ID>",
      "key": "<NEW_KEY>"
	}'
```

```json
{
	"valid": true,
	"remaining": 99
}
```


<Note>
The returned `remaining` value represents how many verifications are remaining after the current one.
A value of 3, means you can verify the key successfully 3 more times.
</Note>



## Custom cost

By default we deduct `1` from the remaining verifications, but in some cases you need to deduct more.

You can override this in the request body. In this example unkey would deduct `4` for every valid verification.
If a key would only have 3 remaining, the request would be rejected, as there is not enough remaining left.


<Note>
  There is a special case when you set `cost = 0`. In this case, the request will always be valid, but will not deduct anything.

</Note>

```bash {7-9}
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.verifyKey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "apiId":"<API_ID>",
    "key": "<NEW_KEY>",
    "remaining": {
      "cost": 4
    }
  }'
```
