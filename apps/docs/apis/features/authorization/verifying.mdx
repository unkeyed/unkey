description: Verifying permissions through the API

Once a key is generated, you can verify it using the [verify](/api-reference/keys/verify) endpoint. Our system verifies whether the key has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action(s). If the user's role grants the required permissions, the request is allowed to proceed; otherwise, access is denied.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Single Permission">
This will return valid if the key has the permission: `admin`
```bash Single Permission

curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.verifyKey \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer unkey_1234' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "key": "sk_1234",
    "authorization": {
      "permissions": "admin"
    }
  }'
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Nested Query">
 This will return valid if the key has either `admin` or both `dns.record.read` and `dns.record.update` permissions.
```bash Nested Query
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.verifyKey \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer unkey_1234' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "key": "sk_1234",
    "authorization": {
      "permissions": {
        "or": [
          "admin",
          {
            "and": [
              "dns.record.read",
              "dns.record.update"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }'
```

Sometimes you just don't know what permissions are required before loading resources from your database.
In these cases you can manually check permissions as well.

<Steps>

<Step title="Verify">
Verify the key and all permissions that you already know before needing to query your database.

If the response is invalid, you can return early.
</Step>

<Step title="Query your database">
The key is at least valid, so you can query our database to fetch more information.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Permissions">

The verification response from step 1 includes all permissions attached to the keys and looks something like this:
```json
{
  valid: true,
  permissions: ["permission1", "permission2", ...]
  //... omited for brevity
}
```

Use the attached permissions and the context loaded from your database to determine if you should proceed handling the request or returning an authorization error.
