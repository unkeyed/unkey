title: Roles and Permissions
---

In RBAC, roles represent a collection of permissions. Each role defines a set of actions or operations that a user with that role can perform. Permissions can be associated with various resources within your application, such as endpoints, data objects, or functionality.

Common roles may include:

- `Administrator`: Has full access to all resources and functionality.
- `Editor`: Can create, read, update, and delete specific resources.
- `Viewer`: Can only view resources but cannot modify them.

## Connecting roles and permissions

After you have created at least 1 role and 1 permission, you can start associating them with each other.


Go to [/app/authorization/roles](https://app.unkey.com/authorization/roles) and click on the role to go to the permissions screen.
Now you can click the checkboxes to connect the role and permission.

A checked box means the role will grant the permission to keys.

  You can connect a role to your key by clicking on the checkbox.

  Let's give this key the `dns.manager` and `read-only` roles.
  A toast message should come up in the lower corner when the action has been completed.

As you can see, now the key now contains 2 `roles` and 5 `permissions` shown just above the Roles section:









## Creating keys

When a user of your app creates a new key, you can attach zero, one or multiple previously created roles to the key.

```bash
curl -XPOST \
  --url https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.createKey \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ROOT_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "${API_ID}",
    "roles": [
      "role1", "role2", "role3"
    ]
  }'
```
See [here](/api-reference/keys/create) for details.
