description: 'Access Control with Roles and Permissions'

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security paradigm that restricts system access to authorized actors. It is based on the principle of assigning roles to actors and defining what actions or resources each role can access. We are taking this one step further and allowing you to attach arbitrary permissions to keys, for more flexibility (Coming in Q2).
