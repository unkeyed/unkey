title: Environments 
description: Separate your keys into live and test environments.
---

For many applications it's useful to provide keys for developing and testing to your users. They can
not interact with real production resources and may have lower ratelimits but use the exact same
flow as your `live` keys.


Unkey allows you to set an arbitrary value as `environment` for each key, so you can model your
domain however you want. In practice we often see two distinct environments being used a lot:

- `live` Live keys are used in production and affect real resources.
- `test` Test keys allow you to develop and test your code without modifying real resources. It's
great to ensure your code is working manually or can be used in automated tests.

You may also want to associate different ratelimits per environment or bill usage differently. 
Perhaps test keys have lower limits but are free to use.


### Creating a key with an environment

Using the prefix to indicate the environment is optional but highly recommended. It can prevent
your user from accidentally using keys interchangably and modifying resources unintentionally.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Test
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "environment": "test",
    "prefix": "sk_test"
  }'
```

```bash Live
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "environment": "live",
    "prefix": "sk_live"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>
For more details, see the [API reference](/api-reference/keys/create)




### Verifying a key

When you are using different environments, you obviously need a way to know what environment the
used key is in.
We provide this as part of the verification response:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.verifyKey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "apiId": "api_1234",
    "key": "sk_1234"
  }'
```
The response would look something like this:
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "environment": "test",
  // ... omited
}

```
