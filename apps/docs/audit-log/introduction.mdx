# Audit logs in detail

The audit logs table displays the following fields:

- **Actor**: who was responsible for the change. This can be either a user (for actions taken in the web app) or a key (for actions taken via the API).
- **Event**: the type of change. You can filter by type of events using the UI. Click to expand for more detail.
- **Location**: the IP address of the actor who made the change.
