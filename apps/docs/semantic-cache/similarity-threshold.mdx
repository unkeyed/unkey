title: Setting similarity threshold
description: Configure the threshold for returning responses from the cache
---

By default, the semantic cache will return a HIT if a previous response is found with a similarity score of 0.9 or above.

You can customize this, if you want to increase cache hit ratio and/or have a higher standard for returning cached responses.

To do so, set the `X-Min-Similarity` header when sending requests to the cache:

```
  const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    baseURL: "https://<gateway>.llm.unkey.io",
    defaultHeaders: {
      'X-Min-Similarity': 0.92x
    }
  });
```
