<Note>
Migration endpoints are currently only available in our v1 API. Bulk operations for v2 are planned for a future release.
</Note>

Wherever you are coming from, we make it easy to migrate your existing API to Unkey.

The challenge with migrating an existing API is that you need to move all of the existing keys and permissions to Unkey. This can be a daunting task, especially if you have a lot of keys.

Common migrations can be done entirely via self-serve APIs, while more complex migrations may require some manual intervention. We are here to help you with your migration.

<Note>
Every system is slightly different, please contact us at [support@unkey.dev](mailto:support@unkey.dev) for help with migrating your keys.
