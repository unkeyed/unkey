description: 'Keys can be revoked at any time, from the API or the dashboard.'

In the event that a key is compromised, you can revoke it at any time. Once the key is revoked, it can take up to 60 seconds for the key to be invalidated. Once invalidated, the key will no longer be able to be used to authenticate requests.
