description: "Enable or disable a key. Disabled keys will not validate."

This feature is useful for disabling a key temperarily. While disabled the key will act as an invalid key until re enabled. 

Example:
Suppose you have a customer that has not paid thier bill. You may not want to delete the key in this case, However the key can be disabled preventing access until enabled again.

Unkey allows you to disable a key on an individual basis. 

### Example

Let's disable a key temperarily blocking access with that key. 

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.updateKey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "enabled": false,
  "keyId": "<keyId>"
}'
```

Now, when you verify the new key, you will get an invalid response.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.verifyKey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
		"key": "<NEW_KEY>"
	}'
```

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DISABLED",
    "docs": "https://unkey.dev/docs/api-reference/errors/code/DISABLED",
    "message": "<string>",
    "requestId": "req_1234"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The returned `remaining` value represents how many verifications are remaining
  after the current one. A value of 3, means you can verify the key successfully
  3 more times.
