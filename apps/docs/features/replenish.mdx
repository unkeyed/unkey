title: Replenish
description: "Refill remaining key uses daily or monthly"
---

Useful for creating and api key that will automatically refill daily or monthly.

Example:
You are selling API access and a customer has purchased 1000 api a month.

Unkey allows you to set a refill interval and increment on individual keys and we take care of replenishing a key after it has reached its set interval.

### Example

Let's create a new key, which can be used 100 times a day. The interval may also be set to "month" if needed.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <UNKEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"apiId":"<API_ID>",
	"remaining": 100,
  "refill": {
      "interval": "daily",
      "increment": 10
  }
}'
```

Now when you verify the new key, you will receive back the remaining verifications and the refill.interval and refill.increment for this key.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys/verify \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
		"key": "<NEW_KEY>"
	}'
```

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "remaining": 99
}
```

<Note>
  The returned `remaining` value represents how many verifications are remaining
  after the current one. A value of 3, means you can verify the key successfully
  3 more times.
