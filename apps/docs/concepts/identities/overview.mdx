<Tip>
  Identities are in public beta, please report any issues you encounter:

</Tip>

Identities are used to map your users, organizations, or even machine-users in Unkey and allow you to share metadata and configuration across multiple keys.
An identity is directly linked via a unique identifier from your system and you can associate as many keys as you want with an identity.

## Use cases

### Multiple keys for the same user

It is very common to issue multiple keys for the same user, but managing metadata and configuration for each key can be cumbersome and error-prone. By associating all keys with the same identity, you can share metadata and configuration across all keys.

Instead of updating each key, you can update the identity and all keys associated with it will automatically get the updated metadata and configuration.

### Sharing ratelimits across multiple keys

If you have multiple keys for the same user, you can set ratelimits for the identity and share it across all keys. This way, you can ensure that the user does not exceed the ratelimits across all of their keys.

[Read more](/concepts/identities/ratelimits) about how to share ratelimits across multiple keys.

### Sharing credits across multiple keys

When you configure credits on an identity, all keys associated with that identity will share the same credit counter. This is useful when:

- A user has multiple devices or API keys and you want to track their total usage across all keys
- You want to enforce a single usage limit per user, regardless of how many keys they have
- You're building a subscription-based product where credit limits are tied to the user, not individual keys

When a key with identity credits makes a request, the credits are deducted from the shared identity counter. This ensures that the total usage across all of a user's keys doesn't exceed their allocated credits.

**Example:** If an identity has 1000 credits and a user creates 3 keys linked to that identity, all 3 keys will share the same 1000 credits. If key A uses 400 credits, keys B and C together can only use the remaining 600 credits.

### Aggregated analytics

If you are building a multi-tenant product, you can associate all keys of an organization with the organization's identity. This way, you can aggregate analytics across all keys of the organization and provide insights to the organization admin or drive your billing.

## Data model

<ParamField body="id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the identity in Unkey. You may use this to reference
  the identity in other API calls.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="externalId" type="string" required>
  The id of the identity in your system. This is used to link the identity in Unkey to your system.
  For example your user id, or organization id if you are linking an organization.

If you are using a 3rd party auth provider like Clerk, WorkOS, or Auth0, they will provide you a unique id for users and organizations. This is what you should use as the externalId.

We want to build deeper integrations with them, so if you are using one of these, please let us know so we can prioritize it.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="meta" type="json">
  A JSON object that can store any additional information about the identity. We
  do not make assumptions about this data, it's entirely up to you to decide
  what to store here.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="ratelimits" type="array">
  An array of ratelimit configurations that apply to all keys associated with this identity.
  When configured, all keys linked to the identity will share these ratelimits, ensuring
  that the total usage across all keys doesn't exceed the specified limits.

  [Read more](/concepts/identities/ratelimits) about sharing ratelimits.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="credits" type="object">
  Credit configuration for the identity. When configured, all keys associated with this
  identity will share the same credit counter. This is useful for enforcing usage limits
  per user regardless of how many keys they have.

  The credits object contains:
  - `remaining` (number): The current number of credits available
  - `refill` (object, optional): Automatic refill configuration
    - `interval` ("daily" | "monthly"): How often credits refill
    - `amount` (number): How many credits to add on refill
    - `refillDay` (number, optional): Day of month for monthly refills (1-31)
