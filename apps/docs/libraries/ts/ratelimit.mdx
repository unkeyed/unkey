> ( Globally consistent, fast ) - choose two

`@unkey/ratelimit` is a library for fast global ratelimiting in serverless functions.


**TLDR:**
```ts
const { success } = await unkey.limit("my-user-id")
if (!success){
  // reject request
}
// handle request
```

## Configure your ratelimiter

```ts
import { Ratelimit } from "@unkey/ratelimit"

const unkey = new Ratelimit({
  rootKey: process.env.UNKEY_ROOT_KEY,
  namespace: "my-app",
  limit: 10,
  duration: "30s",
  async: true
})
```

## Use it

```ts
async function handler(request) {

const identifier = request.getUserId() // or ip or anything else you want

const ratelimit = await unkey.limit(identifier)
if (!ratelimit.success){
  return new Response("try again later", { status: 429 })
}

// handle the request here

}
```

## Making it bullet proof


Everything we do is built for scale and stability.
We built on some of the world's most stable platforms ([Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)) and run an extensive test suite before and after every deployment.

Even so, we would be fools if we wouldn't explain how you can put in safe guards along the way.


In case of severe network degredations or other unforseen events, you might want to put an upper bound on how long you are willing to wait for a response from unkey.
By default the SDK will reject a request if it hasn't received a response from unkey within 5 seconds. You can tune this via the `timeout` config in the constructor (see below).

The SDK captures most errors and handles them on its own, but we also encourage you to add a `onError` handler to configure what happens in case something goes wrong.

Both `fallback` property of the `timeout` config and `onError` config are callback functions. They receive the original request identifier as one of their parameters, which you can use to determine whether to reject the request.

```ts
import { Ratelimit } from "@unkey/ratelimit"

// In this example we decide to let requests pass, in case something goes wrong.
// But you can of course also reject them if you want.
const fallback = (identifier: string) => ({ success: true, limit: 0, reset: 0, remaining: 0 })

const unkey = new Ratelimit({
  // ... standard stuff
  timeout: {
    ms: 3000, // only wait 3s at most before returning the fallback
    fallback
  },
  onError: (err, identifier) => {
    console.error(`${identifier} - ${err.message}`)
    return fallback(identifier)
  }
})

const { success } = await unkey.limit(identifier)
```

## API

### `new Ratelimit(config: RatelimitConfig)`

Create a new instance for ratelimiting by providing the necessary configuration.


<ParamField  body="RatelimitConfig" type="object" required >
<Expandable title="RatelimitConfig">
<ParamField body="limit" type="number" required>
How many requests may pass in the given duration.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="duration" type="Duration | number" required placeholder="60s">
How long the window should be.

Either a type string literal like `60s`, `20m` or plain milliseconds.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="rootKey" type="string" required>
The unkey root key. You can create one at [app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys](https://app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys)

Make sure the root key has permissions to use ratelimiting.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="namespace" type="string" required placeholder="tRPC">
Namespaces allow you to separate different areas of your app and have isolated limits.
Make sure the root key has permissions to use ratelimiting.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="timeout" type="object | false" default={{ms: 5000,fallback: { success: false, limit: 0, remaining: 0, reset: Date.now()} }}>
Configure a timeout to prevent network issues from blocking your function for too long.

Disable it by setting `timeout: false`

<Warning>
Timeouts rely on `Date.now()`. In cloudflare workers time doesn't progress unless there is some io happening, which means the timeout might not work as expected.
Other runtimes are working.
</Warning>


<Expandable defaultOpen>

<ParamField body="ms" type="number" default={5000}>
Time in milliseconds until the response is returned.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="fallback" type="object" default={{ success: false, limit: 0, remaining: 0, reset: Date.now()} }>
A custom response to return when the timeout is reached.

The important bit is the `success` value, choose whether you want to let requests pass or not.
</ParamField>
</Expandable>



</ParamField>

<ParamField body="onError" type="() => RatelimitResponse | Promise<RatelimitResponse>">
Configure what happens for unforeseen errors


Example letting requests pass:
 ```ts
   onError: ()=> ({ success: true, limit: 0, remaining: 0, reset: 0})
 ```

Example rejecting the request:
 ```ts
   onError: ()=> ({ success: true, limit: 0, remaining: 0, reset: 0})
 ```




</ParamField>

</ParamField>

### `.limit(identifier: string, opts: LimitOptions): Promise<RatelimitResponse>`

Check whether a specific identifier is currently allowed to do something or if they have currently exceeded their limit.

<ParamField  body="LimitOptions" type="object" required >
<Expandable title="LimitOptions">
<ParamField body="cost" type="number" default={1}>
Expensive requests may use up more resources. You can specify a cost to the request and
 we'll deduct this many tokens in the current window. If there are not enough tokens left,
 the request is denied.

**Example:**

 1. You have a limit of 10 requests per second you already used 4 of them in the current
 window.

 2. Now a new request comes in with a higher cost:
 ```ts
 const res = await rl.limit("identifier", { cost: 4 })
 ```

 3. The request passes and the current limit is now at `8`

 4. The same request happens again, but would not be rejected, because it would exceed the
 limit in the current window: `8 + 4 > 10`



</ParamField>

<ParamField body="async" type="boolean" default={false}>
Do not wait for a response from the origin. Faster but less accurate.

We observe a 97%+ accuracy when using `async` mode with significantly lower latency.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="meta" type=" Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;">
Record arbitrary data about this request. This does not affect the limit itself but can help you debug later.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="resources" type="Array<{
    type: string;
    id: string;
    name?: string;
    meta?: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;
  }>">
Specify which resources this request would access and we'll create a papertrail for you.

See [app.unkey.com/audit](https://app.unkey.com/audit) for details.

### `RatelimitResponse`


<ParamField  body="RatelimitResponse" type="object" >
<Expandable title="RatelimitResponse">
<ParamField body="success" type="boolean" required>
Whether the request may pass(true) or exceeded the limit(false).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="limit" type="number" required>
Maximum number of requests allowed within a window.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="remaining" type="number" required>
How many requests the user has left within the current window.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="reset" type="number" required>
Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the limits are reset.
</ParamField>
