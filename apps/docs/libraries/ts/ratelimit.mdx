> ( Globally consistent, fast ) - choose two

`@unkey/ratelimit` is a library for fast global ratelimiting in serverless functions.

We use Cloudflare workers and Durable Objects to orchestrate low latency ratelimiting at the edge, without sacrificing consistency.


**TLDR:**
```ts
const { success } = await unkey.limit("my-user-id")
if (!success){
  // reject request
}
// handle request
```

## Configure your ratelimiter

```ts
import { Ratelimit } from "@unkey/ratelimit"

const unkey = new Ratelimit({
  rootKey: process.env.UNKEY_ROOT_KEY,
  namespace: "my-app",
  limit: 10,
  duration: "30s",
  async: true
})
```

## Use it

```ts
async function handler(request) {

const identifier = request.getUserId() // or ip or anything else you want

const ratelimit = await unkey.limit(identifier)
if (!ratelimit.success){
  return new Response("try again later", { status: 429 })
}

// handle the request here

}
```

## Making it bullet proof


Everything we do is built for scale and stability.
We built on some of the world's most stable platforms ([Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)) and run an extensive test suite before and after every deployment.

Even so, we would be fools if we wouldn't explain how you can put in safe guards along the way.


In case of severe network degredations or other unforseen events, you might want to put an upper bound on how long you are willing to wait for a response from unkey. 
By default the SDK will reject a request if it hasn't received a response from unkey within 5 seconds. You can tune this via the `timeout` config in the constructor (see below).

The SDK captures most errors and handles them, but we also encourage you to add a `.catch` handler configure what happens in case something goes wrong.


```ts
import { Ratelimit } from "@unkey/ratelimit"

// In this example we decide to let requests pass, in case something goes wrong.
// But you can of course also reject them if you want.
const fallback = { success: true, limit: 0, reset: 0, remaining: 0 }

const unkey = new Ratelimit({
  // ... standard stuff
  timeout: {
    ms: 3000, // only wait 3s at most before returning the fallback
    fallback
  }

})

const { success } = await unkey.limit(identifier).catch(err => {
  console.error(err.message)
  return fallback
})
```

## Options

### `new Ratelimit(config: RatelimitConfig)`


```ts 
export type RatelimitConfig = {
  /**
   * How many requests may pass in the given duration
   */
  limit: number;

  /**
   * Either a type string literal or milliseconds
   */
  duration: Duration | number;

  /**
   * The unkey root key. You can create one at https://unkey.dev/app/settings/root-keys
   *
   * Make sure the root key has permissions to use ratelimiting.
   */
  rootKey: string;

  /**
   * Namespaces allow you to separate different areas of your app and have isolated limits.
   *
   * @example tRPC-routes
   */
  namespace: string;

  /**
   * Configure a timeout to prevent network issues from blocking your function for too long.
   *
   * Disable it by setting `timeout: false`
   *
   * @default
   * ```ts
   * {
   *   // 5 seconds
   *   ms: 5000,
   *   fallback: { success: false, limit: 0, remaining: 0, reset: Date.now()}
   * }
   * ```
   */
  timeout?:
    | {
        /**
         * Time in milliseconds until the response is returned
         */
        ms: number | Duration;

        /**
         * A custom response to return when the timeout is reached.
         *
         * The important bit is the `success` value, choose whether you want to let requests pass or not.
         *
         * @example
         * ```ts
         * {
         *   // 5 seconds
         *   ms: 5000
         *   fallback: { success: true, limit: 0, remaining: 0, reset: 0}
         * }
         * ```
         */
        fallback: RatelimitResponse;
      }
    | false;
};
```

### `.limit(identifier: string, opts: LimitOptions)`

```ts LimitOptions
export type LimitOptions = {
  /**
   * Separate requests into groups, groups are combined with your identifier and can be filtered
   * and searched later.
   *
   * @example `group: "send.email"` -> `send.email_${userId}`
   * 
   */
  // group?: string;

  /**
   * Expensive requests may use up more resources. You can specify a cost to the request and
   * we'll deduct this many tokens in the current window. If there are not enough tokens left,
   * the request is denied.
   *
   * @example
   *
   * 1. You have a limit of 10 requests per second you already used 4 of them in the current
   * window.
   *
   * 2. Now a new request comes in with a higher cost:
   * ```ts
   * const res = await rl.limit("identifier", { cost: 4 })
   * ```
   *
   * 3. The request passes and the current limit is now at `8`
   *
   * 4. The same request happens again, but would not be rejected, because it would exceed the
   * limit in the current window: `8 + 4 > 10`
   *
   *
   * @default 1
   */
  cost?: number;

  /**
   * Override the default limit.
   *
   * This takes precedence over the limit defined in the constructor as well as any limits defined
   * for this identifier in Unkey.
   */
  // limit?: Limit;

  /**
   * Do not wait for a response from the origin. Faster but less accurate.
   *
   * We observe a 97%+ accuracy when using `async` mode with significantly lower latency.
   */
  async?: boolean;

  /**
   * Record arbitrary data about this request. This does not affect the limit itself but can help
   * you debug later.
   */
  meta?: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;

  /**
   * Specify which resources this request would access and we'll create a papertrail for you.
   *
   * @see https://unkey.dev/app/audit
   */
  resources?: {
    type: string;
    id: string;
    name?: string;
    meta?: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;
  }[];
};
