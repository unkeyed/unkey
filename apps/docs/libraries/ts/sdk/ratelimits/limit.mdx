<RequestExample>

```ts
const {result, error} = await unkey.ratelimits.limit({
    duration: 600,
    identifier: "userId",
    limit: 2000,
    namespace: "test"
  })

if (error) {
  // handle potential network or bad request error
  // a link to our docs will be in the `error.docs` field
  console.error(error.message);
  return;
}

if(!result.success){
  console.log("This is blocked do some logic")
  return;
}

console.log(result);

```

</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "result": {
    "success": true,
    "limit": 2000,
    "reset": 1630000000000,
    "remaining": 300
  }
}
```

<Note>
We have a dedicated package for ratelimiting in serverless functions. It's built with Cloudflare workers and Durable Objects to orchestrate low latency ratelimiting at the edge, without sacrificing consistency.

Check out the documentation for the [`@unkey/ratelimit` package](/libraries/ts/ratelimit).

## Request

<ParamField body="limit" type="number" required>
How many requests may pass in the given duration.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="duration" type="Duration | number" required placeholder="60s">
How long the window should be.

Either a type string literal like `60s`, `20m` or plain milliseconds.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="identifier" type="string" required>
  A unique identifier for the request. This can be a user id, an IP address or a session id.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="namespace" type="string">
  The route or resource of what is being ratelimited for example `trpc.user.update`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="cost" type="number" default={1}>
Expensive requests may use up more resources. You can specify a cost to the request and
 we'll deduct this many tokens in the current window. If there are not enough tokens left,
 the request is denied.

**Example:**

 1. You have a limit of 10 requests per second you already used 4 of them in the current
 window.

 2. Now a new request comes in with a higher cost:
 ```ts
 const res = await rl.limit("identifier", { cost: 4 })
 ```

 3. The request passes and the current limit is now at `8`

 4. The same request happens again, but would not be rejected, because it would exceed the
 limit in the current window: `8 + 4 > 10`



</ParamField>
<ParamField body="async" type="boolean" default={false}>
Do not wait for a response from the origin. Faster but less accurate.

We observe a 97%+ accuracy when using `async` mode with significantly lower latency.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="meta" type=" Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;">
Record arbitrary data about this request. This does not affect the limit itself but can help you debug later.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="resources" type="Array<{
    type: string;
    id: string;
    name?: string;
    meta?: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;
  }>">
Specify which resources this request would access and we'll create a papertrail for you.
