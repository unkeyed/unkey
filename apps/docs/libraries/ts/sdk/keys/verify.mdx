## Request

<ParamField body="key" type="string" required>
  The key you want to verify.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="apiId" type="string" >
  The api this key belongs to. This will be required soon.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="ratelimit" type="object" >
  Override the behavior of the ratelimit for this verification. 
<Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>
<ParamField body="cost" type="number" default={1}>
  The cost of this verification. This will be subtracted from the ratelimit.

## Response

<ResponseField name="result">
<Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>

  Whether or not this key is valid and has passed the ratelimit. If `false` you
  should not grant access to whatever the user is requesting

  If the key is invalid this field will be set to the reason why it is invalid.

  Possible values are:

  checks like `IP whitelists`

  - `RATE_LIMITED` - The verification has been blocked due to ratelimiting
  - `DISABLED` - the key is disabled
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ownerId" type="string">
  If you have set an `ownerId` on this key it is returned here. You can use this
  to clearly authenticate a user in your system.

<ResponseField name="expires" type="int">
  The unix timestamp in milliseconds indicating when this key expires.
</ResponseField>
