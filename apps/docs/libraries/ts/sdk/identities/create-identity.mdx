title: "Create An Identity"
description: "Create a new identity in the system. This might not be necessary as newly created keys automatically create an identity if required."

<RequestExample>

```ts
const { result, error } = await unkey.identities.create({
  externalId: "user_123",
  ratelimits: [
    {
      name: "tokens",
      limit: 10,
      duration: 1000,
    },
  ],
});

if (error) {
  // handle potential network or bad request error
  // a link to our docs will be in the `error.docs` field
  console.error(error.message);
  return;
}

console.log(result);
```

</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "result": {
    "identityId": "id_123"
  }
}
```
</ResponseExample>


## Request

<ParamField body="externalId" type="string" required>
    The id of this identity in your system.

    This usually comes from your authentication provider and could be a userId, organisationId or even an email.

    It does not matter what you use, as long as it uniquely identifies something in your application.

    externalIds are unique across your workspace and therefore a CONFLICT error is returned when you try to create duplicates.

    Minimum length: `3`

    Example: `"user_123"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="meta" type="object" >
This is a place for dynamic meta data, anything that feels useful for you should go here

Example:

```json
{
  "billingTier": "PRO",
  "trialEnds": "2023-06-16T17:16:37.161Z"
}
```
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="ratelimits" type="object[]" >
  Attach ratelimits to this identity.

  When verifying keys, you can specify which limits you want to use and all keys attached to this identity, will share the limits.

  <Expandable title="properties">
  <ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
  The name of this limit. You will need to use this again when verifying a key.

  Example:`"tokens"`
  </ParamField>

<ParamField body="limit" type="int" required>
  How many requests may pass within a given window before requests are rejected.

   Required range: `x >= 1`

   Example:`10`

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="duration" type="int" required>
  The duration for each ratelimit window in milliseconds.

  Required range: `x >= 1000`

  Example: `1000`
</ParamField>
</Expandable>
</ParamField>
## Response

<ResponseField name="identityId" type="string" required>
  The id of the identity. Used internally, you do not need to store this.


  Example: `"id_123"`

</ResponseField>
