Go client [unkey-go](https://github.com/WilfredAlmeida/unkey-go) for interacting with the platform programatically.

## Installation

To use the `unkey-go` SDK in your Go project, you can simply import it using Go modules:

```shell
go get github.com/WilfredAlmeida/unkey-go
```

## Unkey Root Key

When requesting resources, you will need your root key â€” you can create a new one in the [settings](https://app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys).

Always keep your root key safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
