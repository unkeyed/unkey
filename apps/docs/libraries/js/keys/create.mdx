## Request

<ParamField body="apiId" type="string" required>
Choose an `API` where this key should be created.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="prefix" type="string" >
To make it easier for your users to understand which product an api key belongs to, you can add prefix them.

For example Stripe famously prefixes their customer ids with `cus_` or their api keys with `sk_live_`.

The underscore is automtically added if you are defining a prefix, for example: `"prefix": "abc"` will result in a key like `abc_xxxxxxxxx`

</ParamField>


<ParamField body="byteLength" type="int" default={16} >
The bytelength used to generate your key determines its entropy as well as its length.
Higher is better, but keys become longer and more annoying to handle.

The default is `16 bytes`, or 2<sup>128</sup> possible combinations
 </ParamField>


 <ParamField body="ownerId" type="string" >
  Your user's Id. This will provide a link between Unkey and your customer record.

  When validating a key, we will return this back to you, so you can clearly identify your user from their api key.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="meta" type="object" >
This is a place for dynamic meta data, anything that feels useful for you should go here

Example:
```json
{
  "billingTier":"PRO",
  "trialEnds": "2023-06-16T17:16:37.161Z"
}
```

</ParamField>
<ParamField body="expires" type="int" >
  You can auto expire keys by providing a unix timestamp in milliseconds.

  Once keys expire they will automatically be deleted and are no longer valid.


</ParamField>

<ParamField body="ratelimit" type="Object" >

 Unkey comes with per-key ratelimiting out of the box.

  <Expandable title="properties">

  <ParamField body="type" type="string" default="fast" required>
  Either `fast` or `consistent`.

  Read more [here](/features/ratelimiting)

  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="limit" type="int" required>
  The total amount of burstable requests.


  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="refillRate" type="int" required>
  How many tokens to refill during each `refillInterval`
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="refillInterval" type="int" required>
  Determines the speed at which tokens are refilled.

  In milliseconds
  </ParamField>
 </Expandable>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="remaining" type="number" >
 Add how many times a key can be used, for example 100. 
 Read more [here](/features/remaining)
</ParamField>
