If you prefer a typed experience over calling http endpoints directly, you can use our sdk `@unkey/api`.

## Bearer Token

When requesting resources, you will need your access token â€” you can create a new one in the [settings](https://unkey.dev/app/keys).
Afterwards you need to provide it to the client:

```ts
import { Unkey } from "@unkey/api"

const unkey = new Unkey({token: "<UNKEY_TOKEN>" })
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
