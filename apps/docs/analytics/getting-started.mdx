description: "Request access and run your first analytics query"
---

<Warning>
  **Analytics is currently in private beta and opt-in only.**

To request access, please email us at [support@unkey.dev](mailto:support@unkey.dev) with your workspace ID and use case.

</Warning>

## Request Access

Analytics is currently available by request only. To get started:

1. **Find your workspace ID** in the Unkey dashboard settings
2. **Email us** at [support@unkey.dev](mailto:support@unkey.dev) with:
   - Your workspace ID
   - Your use case (billing, dashboards, reporting, etc.)
   - Expected query volume

We'll enable analytics for your workspace within 24 hours and send you confirmation.

## Authentication

Analytics queries require a root key with analytics permissions. Create one in your dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Root Keys**
2. Click **Create New Root Key**
3. Select permissions: `api.*.read_analytics`
4. Copy and securely store your root key

<Warning>
  Root keys have powerful permissions. Store them securely and never commit them
  to version control.
</Warning>

## Your First Query

Once you have access, execute your first analytics query. Here are some common examples to get started:

### Count Total Verifications

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
```

### Break Down by Outcome

```sql
SELECT
  outcome,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM key_verifications
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY outcome
ORDER BY count DESC
```

### Top Users by Usage

```sql
SELECT
  external_id,
  COUNT(*) as verifications
FROM key_verifications
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY external_id
ORDER BY verifications DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## Understanding the Response

Analytics queries return data as an array of objects:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "req_xxx"
  },
  "data": {
    "verifications": [
      { "outcome": "VALID", "count": 1234 },
      { "outcome": "RATE_LIMITED", "count": 56 }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each object in `verifications` contains fields from your SELECT clause.

## Working with Time

All timestamps in Unkey Analytics are stored as **Unix milliseconds** (Int64). Use ClickHouse date functions to work with time ranges in your queries.

**Time filtering examples:**

```sql
-- Last 7 days
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY

-- Last 24 hours
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR

-- Last 30 days
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY

-- Last month
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH
```

## Filtering by API or User

You can filter queries using your API IDs and user identifiers directly. Use fields like `api_id` and `external_id` with standard SQL operators: `=`, `!=`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `<`, `>`, etc.

## Resource Limits

To protect our infrastructure and ensure fair usage, queries are subject to resource limits:

| Limit              | Value             | Error Code                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Max execution time | 30 seconds        | `query_execution_timeout`          |
| Max memory         | 1 GB              | `query_memory_limit_exceeded`      |
| Max rows to read   | 10 million        | `query_rows_limit_exceeded`        |
| Max result rows    | 10 million        | `query_result_rows_limit_exceeded` |
| Query quota        | 1000 queries/hour | `query_quota_exceeded`             |

If you hit these limits, try:

- Adding more filters to reduce data scanned
- Using aggregated tables (hourly/daily) instead of raw events
- Reducing the time range
- Adding a LIMIT clause
- Using SAMPLE to process a subset of data

## Error Handling

Analytics queries return structured error codes including `query_execution_timeout`, `query_memory_limit_exceeded`, and `invalid_analytics_query`. See the [Error Codes](/errors/overview) documentation for a complete list of error codes.
