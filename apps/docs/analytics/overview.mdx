## What is Unkey Analytics?

Unkey Analytics provides a powerful SQL interface to query your API key verification data. Instead of building your own analytics pipeline, you can leverage Unkey's built-in data warehouse to:

- **Build custom dashboards** for internal teams or end-users
- **Power usage-based billing** by querying verification counts per user/organization
- **Generate reports** on API usage patterns, top users, and performance metrics
- **Monitor and alert** on verification outcomes, rate limits, and errors

## Why SQL?

We chose SQL because it's:

- **Universal** - developers already know it
- **Powerful** - complex aggregations, joins, and filters
- **Flexible** - adapt queries to your specific needs
- **Future-proof** - easily add new metrics without API changes

## How it Works

Every key verification request is automatically stored and aggregated across multiple time-series tables:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Verify Key Request] --> B[Raw Events Table]
    B --> C[Minute Aggregates]
    C --> D[Hour Aggregates]
    D --> E[Day Aggregates]
    E --> F[Month Aggregates]
```

You can query these tables using standard SQL to:
- Aggregate verification counts by time period
- Group by API, user, or outcome
- Filter by region, tags, or custom criteria
- Calculate metrics for billing or monitoring

## Available Data

Every verification event contains:

| Field           | Type          | Description                                                                                                                               |

| `key_space_id`  | String        | Your KeySpace identifier (e.g., `ks_1234`). Find this in your API settings.                                                               |
| `external_id`   | String        | Your user's identifier (e.g., `user_abc`)                                                                                                 |
| `key_id`        | String        | Individual key identifier                                                                                                                 |
| `outcome`       | String        | Verification result: `VALID`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `INVALID`, `EXPIRED`, `DISABLED`, `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS`, `FORBIDDEN`, `USAGE_EXCEEDED` |
| `region`        | String        | Unkey region that handled the verification                                                                                                |
| `tags`          | Array(String) | Custom tags added during verification                                                                                                     |
| `spent_credits` | Int64         | Number of credits spent on this verification (0 if no credits were spent)                                                                 |
