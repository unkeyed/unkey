title: Query Examples
description: "Common SQL patterns for analytics and billing"
---

This guide provides SQL query examples for common analytics scenarios covering all the use cases from the legacy API and more. All examples use ClickHouse SQL syntax and work with the `/v2/analytics.getVerifications` endpoint.

## Using Queries in API Requests

When making API requests, you need to format the SQL query as a JSON string on a single line. Here's how:

**Readable format (for documentation):**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
```

**JSON format (for API requests):**

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM key_verifications_v1 WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY"
}
```

<Tip>
  Each example below shows both the readable multi-line SQL and the single-line
  JSON format you can copy directly into your API requests.
</Tip>

## Using Aggregated Tables

For better performance on large time ranges, use pre-aggregated tables:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Hourly aggregates">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Daily aggregates">

```sql
SELECT
  time,
  SUM(count) as total
FROM key_verifications_per_day_v1

```

**JSON format:**

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT time, SUM(count) as total FROM key_verifications_per_day_v1 WHERE time >= toStartOfDay(now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY) GROUP BY time ORDER BY time"

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Monthly aggregates">

```sql

```

**JSON format:**

```json

```

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Efficient Queries

1. **Always filter by time** - Use indexes by including time filters
2. **Use aggregated tables** - Hourly/daily/monthly tables for longer ranges
3. **Add LIMIT clauses** - Prevent returning too much data
4. **Filter before grouping** - Use WHERE instead of HAVING when possible
