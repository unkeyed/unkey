title: Query Examples
description: "Common SQL patterns for analytics and billing"
---

This guide provides SQL query examples for common analytics scenarios covering all the use cases from the legacy API and more. All examples use ClickHouse SQL syntax and work with the `/v2/analytics.getVerifications` endpoint.

## Using Queries in API Requests

When making API requests, you need to format the SQL query as a JSON string on a single line. Here's how:

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/analytics.getVerifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ROOT_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM key_verifications_v1 WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Each example below shows both the readable multi-line SQL and the single-line
  JSON format you can copy directly into your API requests.
</Tip>

## Usage Analytics

### Total verifications in the last 7 days

Count total verifications across all APIs in the last 7 days.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
SELECT SUM(count) as total_verifications
FROM key_verifications_per_day_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/analytics.getVerifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ROOT_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "SELECT SUM(count) as total_verifications FROM key_verifications_per_day_v1 WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### Verifications by outcome

Break down verifications by outcome to understand success vs failure rates.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
SELECT
  outcome,
  SUM(count) as count
FROM key_verifications_per_day_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY outcome
ORDER BY count DESC
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/analytics.getVerifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ROOT_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "SELECT outcome, SUM(count) as count FROM key_verifications_per_day_v1 WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY GROUP BY outcome ORDER BY count DESC"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using Aggregated Tables

For better performance on large time ranges, use pre-aggregated tables:

### Hourly aggregates

Query hourly verification counts for the last 7 days.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
SELECT
  time,
  SUM(count) as total
FROM key_verifications_per_hour_v1
WHERE time >= toStartOfHour(now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/analytics.getVerifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ROOT_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "SELECT time, SUM(count) as total FROM key_verifications_per_hour_v1 WHERE time >= toStartOfHour(now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY) GROUP BY time ORDER BY time"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### Daily aggregates

Query daily verification counts for the last 30 days.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
SELECT

### Monthly aggregates

Query monthly verification counts for the last year.

<CodeGroup>
```sql SQL
SELECT
  time,
  SUM(count) as total
FROM key_verifications_per_month_v1
WHERE time >= toStartOfMonth(now() - INTERVAL 12 MONTH)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/analytics.getVerifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ROOT_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "SELECT time, SUM(count) as total FROM key_verifications_per_month_v1 WHERE time >= toStartOfMonth(now() - INTERVAL 12 MONTH) GROUP BY time ORDER BY time"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Tips for Efficient Queries

1. **Always filter by time** - Use indexes by including time filters
2. **Use aggregated tables** - Hourly/daily/monthly tables for longer ranges
3. **Add LIMIT clauses** - Prevent returning too much data
4. **Filter before grouping** - Use WHERE instead of HAVING when possible
