## 1. Create your Unkey account

The first step to using Unkey is to create an account. You can do this by visiting [unkey.dev](https://unkey.dev/app) or by clicking the Dashboard button in the top right of your screen.

## 2. Create your first workspace

As soon as you create your account you will be asked to create your workspace. Give it a name, and a slug. Currently the name and slug cannot be changed, so choose wisely!

## 3. Create a root API Key

A root API Key is a special API Key that allows you full read and write access to all current and future resources. It's important to keep this API Key safe, as it allows you to create, revoke, validate and delete API Keys.

Select your workspace from the left hand menu and click the keys button in the menu. Then select Create Key from the top right of the screen.

## 3. Create your first API

Once you've created your workspace, you'll be taken to the dashboard. From here you can create your first API. Select APIs from the left hand menu and click the Create API button.

Give it a name, don't worry the name isn't visible to your users, it's just for you to keep track of your APIs.

## 4. Create your first API Key

Now that you have your API created, you can create your first API Key. Select Create Keys from the top right of the screen. You can create as many keys as you like, but for now we'll just create one.

When you select Create Keys, you'll be asked to enter a prefix for your API Key. This is the part of the API Key that is visible to your users. For example, if you enter `unkey` as your prefix, your users will see API Keys that look like this: `unkey_xxx`.

You will also be asked how many bytes you want to use for your API Key. The more bytes you use, the more secure your API Key will be. We recommend using at least 16 bytes.

Finally the last required field is Owner, this is an id of your tenant or user in your system. This allows you to both identify the owner of the API Key, and also to validate the API Key when it is used.

Once you click Create, you will be shown the newly created API Key. With example cURL command to show how to create a new API Key

This API Key is shown only once, so make sure you copy it and store it somewhere safe.
