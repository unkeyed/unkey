## 3. Create your first API

Next we will get you to create your first API. This is the API that you will be protecting with Unkey. You can create as many APIs as you like, but for now we'll just create one.

## 4. Follow the Unkey getting started guide

Next up we will walk you through the process of using Unkey to protect your API. Including creating your first key, and using it to make a request to verify it.
