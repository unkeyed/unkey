To interact with the Unkey API to manage resources such as APIs or keys, you need a `root key`.

`Root keys` are scoped per workspace and you can fine tune their access permissions when creating a key or update later on the fly.

<Note>
  It's a good practice to provide as few permissions as possible, to minimize the potential impact of a leaked key.

Go to [https://app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys/new](https://app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys/new)

<Step title="Name and Permissions">

1. Optionally enter a name. This is internal only and not customer facing.
2. Add your workspace-wide permissions. These permissions affect and override the per-api permissions below.
3. For each API in your workspace, you can enable fine grained permissions.
4. Click `Create New Key` at the bottom

## What should I do if a root key is leaked?

If you leak a root key - for instance, by accidentally checking it in to version control - you should immediately revoke the root key and replace it with a new, secure key. Root keys are secrets, and should never be exposed publicly.
