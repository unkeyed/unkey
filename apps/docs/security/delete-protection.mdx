# Delete Protection

Delete Protection is a safety feature that prevents accidental deletion of your APIs. When enabled, it blocks all deletion attempts through both the dashboard and API.

## Overview

Delete Protection adds an extra layer of security to your APIs by:

- Preventing accidental deletion of critical APIs
- Requiring explicit confirmation to disable protection
- Creating an audit trail of protection changes
- Blocking deletion attempts through both UI and API

## Enabling Delete Protection

1. Navigate to your API settings in the dashboard
2. Click "Enable Delete Protection" to activate protection
3. Type the API name to confirm
4. Click "Enable API Delete Protection" to add protection 

Once enabled, the API cannot be deleted until protection is explicitly disabled.

## Disabling Delete Protection

To disable Delete Protection:

1. Navigate to your API settings in the dashboard
2. Click "Disable Delete Protection"
3. Type the API name to confirm
4. Click "Disable API Delete Protection" to remove protection

## API Behavior

When Delete Protection is enabled:

- All deletion attempts are blocked
- The API returns a `DELETE_PROTECTED` error
- The error includes a link to this documentation

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DELETE_PROTECTED",
    "docs": "https://unkey.com/docs/api-reference/errors/code/DELETE_PROTECTED",
    "message": "api [apiId] is protected from deletions",
    "requestId": "req_1234"
  }
}
```

## Audit Trail

All changes to Delete Protection are logged in the audit trail, including:

- Who made the change
- When the change occurred
- The API name
- The new protection status

## Best Practices

1. **Enable for Production APIs**: Always enable Delete Protection for APIs in production
2. **Use for Critical Resources**: Protect APIs that contain important data or configurations
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically review protection status of your APIs
4. **Team Communication**: Inform team members about protected APIs
5. **Documentation**: Document which APIs are protected and why

## Limitations

- Delete Protection only prevents deletion of the API
- It does not prevent modifications to the API
- It does not prevent deletion of API keys
- Protection can be disabled by any user with appropriate permissions
- Changes to protection status are logged but cannot be prevented
