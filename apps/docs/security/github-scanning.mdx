Unkey has partnered with GitHub to scan repositories for leaked keys. 

`GitHub Secret Scanning` uses a regular expression to scan repositories for keys matching **Unkey root keys**. 
If a key is found Github will send a request to our API. Once the key has been validated to be a real key, we will email you with details about this leak. 

This is a service that is automatic and requires nothing from you to function. However outside of GitHub we will not be able to inform you if a key has leaked.
