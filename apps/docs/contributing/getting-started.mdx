  <Step title="Setup local development">
  Unkey provides a CLI to setup our local development environment. Run the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  pnpm local
  ```
  <info>
  Docker must be running for us to spin up the database.
  </info>
  This will guide you through setup of the local development environment for either our web app or marketing site.

  </Step>
</Steps>
  ### API

  <Info>
  You do not need this if you are just working on the web app.
  </Info>
  The API runs on `workerd`, thus you need to populate `apps/api/.dev.vars` instead of `.env` with the same values as above.

  ```
  DATABASE_HOST=aws.connect.psdb.cloud
  DATABASE_USERNAME=...
  DATABASE_PASSWORD=pscale_pw_....
  ```
#### Running the API
    ```bash
    cd apps/api
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The development server runs on `:8787` by default.
