### Services

There are a few 3rd party services that are required to run the app:

- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com?ref=unkey): Database
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com?ref=unkey): Authentication

You also need the following tools installed.

- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Setup" >
    Get the repo [here.](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey)
    ```bash
    git clone github.com/unkeyed/unkey
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install">
    ```bash
    cd unkey
    pnpm install
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Environment variable files">
  Copy the example files `/apps/web/.env.example` and `/apps/api/.dev.vars.example` respectively.

  ```bash
  cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
  cp apps/api/.dev.vars.example apps/api/.dev.vars
  ```
</Step>

  <Step title="Prepare Database">
  #### Web App
  For the Unkey dashboard in `apps/web/.env`, the following variables will be used after you create your database:

  ```
  DATABASE_HOST=aws.connect.psdb.cloud
  DATABASE_USERNAME=...
  DATABASE_PASSWORD=pscale_pw_....
  ```

  #### API

  <Info>
  You do not need this is if you are just working on the web app.
</Info>
  The API runs on `workerd`, thus you need to populate `apps/api/.dev.vars` instead of `.env` with the same values as above.

  ```
  DATABASE_HOST=aws.connect.psdb.cloud
  DATABASE_USERNAME=...
  DATABASE_PASSWORD=pscale_pw_....
  ```



  ### Drizzle Schema
    To use Drizzle we need to push the schema, run the following command in your terminal

    > Make sure you replace `user`, `password`, `host` and `db` with your own values

    ```bash
    cd internal/db
    DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL='mysql://{user}:{password}@{host}/{db}?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}' pnpm drizzle-kit push:mysql
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clerk">
  Create a new application via their [dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com?ref=unkey).

  Add the following to your web app .env
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
  ```

  Once you have created the application, you need to create a single user from the UI (in the users section) and then enable and create an organization. When you create the organization you will be provided an organization ID.

  > You need the organization ID for the next step.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Bootstrap">
    Unkey uses itself to manage its own API keys. To bootstrap the app, run the following command:

    You need to provide the database credentials as well as the organization ID from clerk as `TENANT_ID`

    ```bash

    export DATABASE_HOST=aws.connect.psdb.cloud
    export DATABASE_USERNAME=...
    export DATABASE_PASSWORD=pscale_pw_....
    export TENANT_ID={clerk org id from previous step}

    pnpm bootstrap
    ```
    The bootstrap will return a `UNKEY_WORKSPACE_ID`, `UNKEY_API_ID` and `UNKEY_KEY_AUTH_ID` which you will need to add to the .env files `/apps/web/.env` and `/apps/agent/.env` respectively.

  </Step>


  <Step title="Run app">

  Open a new terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    pnpm turbo run dev --filter=web
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Develop">
    Finally open your browser at http://localhost:3000/app and login.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the api">
  <Info>
  This is only required if you are working on the API.
  </Info>


    ```bash
    cd apps/api
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The development server runs on `:8787` by default.
  </Step>
</Steps>
