### Services

There are a few 3rd party services that are required to run the app:

- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com?ref=unkey): Database
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com?ref=unkey): Authentication

You also need the following tools installed.

- [Go](https://go.dev)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Setup" >
    Get the repo [here.](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey)

    Set environment variables in `/apps/web/.env` and/or `/apps/agent/.env` respectively and populate the values from the services above.:

    ```sh-session
    cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
    cp apps/agent/.env.example apps/agent/.env
    ```

    For Planetscale the following variables will be used after you create your database:

    ```
    DATABASE_HOST=aws.connect.psdb.cloud
    DATABASE_USERNAME=...
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=pscale_pw_....
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install">
    ```sh-session
    pnpm install
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Database">
    Push the database schema to Planetscale:

    > Make sure you replace `user`, `password`, `host` and `db` with your own values

    ```sh-session
    cd internal/db
    DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL='mysql://{user}:{password}@{host}/{db}?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}' pnpm drizzle-kit push:mysql
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clerk">
  Create a new application via their [dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com?ref=unkey).

  Once you have created the application, you need to create a single user from the UI and then enable and create an organization.

  > You need the organization ID for the next step.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Bootstrap">
    Unkey uses itself to manage its own API keys. To bootstrap the app, run the following command:

    You need to provide the database credentials as well as the organization ID from clerk as `TENANT_ID`

    ```sh-session

    export DATABASE_HOST=
    export DATABASE_USERNAME=
    export DATABASE_PASSWORD=
    export TENANT_ID=

    pnpm bootstrap
    ```
    The bootstrap will return a `UNKEY_WORKSPACE_ID`, `UNKEY_API_ID` and `UNKEY_KEY_AUTH_ID` which you will need to add to the .env files `/apps/web/.env` and `/apps/agent/.env` respectively.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Agent">

    ```sh-session
    cd apps/agent
    go run . agent --env ./.env
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run app">

  Open a new terminal and run the following command:
    ```sh-session
    pnpm build
    pnpm turbo run dev --filter=web
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Develop">
    Finally open your browser at http://localhost:3000/app and go through the onboarding process.
  </Step>
