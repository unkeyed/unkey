### Services

There are a few 3rd party services that are required to run the app:

**Required**

- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com?ref=unkey): Database
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com?ref=unkey): Authentication

**Optional**

- [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co?ref=unkey): Time series database
- [Upstash Kafka](https://upstash.com/kafka?ref=unkey): Cache invalidation

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Setup" >
    Get the repo [here.](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey)

    Set environment variables in `/apps/web/.env` and/or `/apps/agent/.env` respectively and populate the values from the services above.:

    ```sh-session
    cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
    cp apps/agent/.env.example apps/agent/.env
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install">
    ```sh-session
    pnpm install
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Database">
    Push the database schema to Planetscale:

    ```sh-session
    cd internal/db
    DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL='mysql://{user}:{password}@{host}/{db}?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}' pnpm drizzle-kit push:mysql
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tinybird (Optional)">
    Download the Tinybird CLI from [here](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/cli.html) and run the following command after authenticating:

    ```sh-session
    cd packages/tinybird
    tb push ./*.datasource
    tb push
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clerk">
    Create a new app and set it up as described [here](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/get-started-with-nextjs).
    Alternatively, ask on our [discord](https://unkey.dev/discord) for temporary credentials.

    Afterwards, create a new organization in clerk and make a note of the organization ID, you'll need it in the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bootstrap">
    Unkey uses itself to manage its own API keys. To bootstrap the app, run the following command:

    You need to provide the database credentials as well as the organization ID from clerk as `TENANT_ID`

    ```sh-session

    export DATABASE_HOST=
    export DATABASE_USERNAME=
    export DATABASE_PASSWORD=
    export TENANT_ID=

    pnpm bootstrap
    ```

    This sets up the workspace and gets everything ready to run the app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build">
  ```sh-session
    pnpm build
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run API">
    Add a `.env` file in `/apps/agent/.env` and populate the values from the services above.:

    ```sh-session
    cp apps/agent/.env.example apps/agent/.env
    ```

    Then run the api via docker compose:

    ```sh-session
    cd apps/agent
    docker compose up
    ```
  </Step>
