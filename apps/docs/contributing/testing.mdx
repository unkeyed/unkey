We use [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for our unit and integration tests. You can run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

## API Tests

`/apps/api` is our core product and needs to be heavily tested. Unit tests are not enough and we use two types of integration tests:

### `routes`

Spins up a local server within the tests and makes requests to it. 

Routes test require a planetscale compatible database to be running. You can set the following environment variables to configure the database:
  ```bash
  cd apps/api

  DATABASE_HOST=
  DATABASE_USERNAME=
  DATABASE_PASSWORD=
  pnpm test:routes
  ```
### `integration`

Full end to end tests require a running API either locally or in a deployed environment.
  ```bash
  cd apps/api

  UNKEY_BASE_URL=
  UNKEY_ROOT_KEY=
  pnpm test:integration
  ```
