# Repository Version

The main version of the repository is only for the `agent`. Sdks and other libraries have their own independent versioning.


## Workflow

<Steps>
    <Step>
    A release coordinator (RC) calls to stop any merging to the base branch
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The RC pulls down the base branch, runs `pnpm changeset version`, then makes a new PR with the versioning changes
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The versioning changes are merged back into the base branch
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The RC pulls the base branch again and runs `pnpm changeset publish`
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The RC runs `git push --follow-tags` to push the release tags back
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The RC unblocks merging to the base branch
    </Step>
</Steps>
