# Telemetry 

Unkey collects anonymous telemetry data to help us understand usage of the framework. If you're authoring an SDK, you should record usage information and send it via `Upstash-Telemetry` headers.

### Typescript libraries

The Unkey Typescript library `@unkey/api` is already set up to collect telemetry data. If you're writing a new SDK for a framework that makes use of that library
under the hood, you just need to enable the user to disable telemetry; otherwise, pass it in the constructor. You can see an example of this via the Next.js SDK
[here](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/blob/main/packages/nextjs/src/index.ts#L99).

### Telemetry request headers

Unkey records telemetry data via three headers. You can see an example of how this is used in the Typescript SDK [here](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/blob/main/packages/api/src/client.ts#L138)

<ParamField header="Unkey-Telemetry-SDK" type="string">
Comma-separated list of strings recording SDKs. Can be multiple SDKs; for instance, the Next.js SDK will record both the Next.js SDK version and 
Typescript SDK version.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Unkey-Telemetry-Platform" type="string">
Referring to the platform where the calling application is deployed.

For example: `Vercel`, `Cloudflare`, `AWS`, `Deno`
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Unkey-Telemetry-Runtime" type="string">
Referring to the programming runtime.

For example: `edge-light`, `node@18`, `node@20.0.1`
</ParamField>


```bash Sending Telemetry
