The agent is deployed as a cluster of machines to fly.io. Each machine is identical and capable of serving any incoming request.

We run a gossip network between all machines for service discovery and failure detection.
The gossip network will also be used for broadcasting configuration changes and cache invalidations.

On top of the gossip layer, sits a consistent hash ring for sharding any kind of data across the cluster.
