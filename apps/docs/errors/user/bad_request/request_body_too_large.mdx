## What Happened?

Your request was too big! We limit how much data you can send in a single API request to keep everything running smoothly.

This usually happens when you're trying to send a lot of data at once - like huge metadata objects or really long strings in your request.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Trim Down Your Request

The most common cause is putting too much data in the `meta` field or other parts of your request.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Too Big
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_XXXX" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "api_123",
    "name": "My Key",
    "meta": {
      "userProfile": "... really long user profile data ...",
      "settings": { /* huge nested object with tons of properties */ }
    }
  }'
```

```bash Just Right
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_XXXX" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "api_123",
    "name": "My Key",
    "meta": {
      "userId": "user_123",
      "tier": "premium"
    }
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Store Big Data Elsewhere

Instead of cramming everything into your API request:

- Store large data in your own database
- Only send IDs or references to Unkey
- Fetch the full data when you need it

## Need a Higher Limit?

<Note>
**Got a special use case?** If you have a legitimate need to send larger requests, we'd love to hear about it!

[Contact our support team](mailto:support@unkey.com) and include:
- What you're building
- Why you need to send large requests
- An example of the data you're trying to send

We'll work with you to find a solution that works for your use case.
