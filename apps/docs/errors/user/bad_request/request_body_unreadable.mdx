## What Happened?

The server couldn't read your request body. This typically happens when there's an issue with how the request was formed or transmitted.

Common causes include:
- Malformed HTTP request structure
- Network connection closed prematurely during transmission
- Invalid or mismatched `Content-Length` header
- Data corruption during transmission
- Client-side network interruption

## How to Fix It

### 1. Check Your Request Structure

Make sure your HTTP request is properly formatted and all required headers are present:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_XXXX" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "api_123",
    "name": "My Key"
  }'
```

### 2. Check Network Stability

If you're experiencing intermittent failures:
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Check your network connection stability
- Consider timeout values that may be too aggressive

### 3. Avoid Partial Uploads

Ensure you're sending the complete request body in one go, not streaming partial data that might get interrupted.

## Still Having Issues?

<Note>
If you continue to see this error after checking the above:

1. Check your HTTP client library documentation for known issues
2. Try a different HTTP client to isolate the problem
3. [Contact our support team](mailto:support@unkey.dev) with:
   - Your request ID (from the error response)
   - The HTTP client/library you're using
   - Any network logs or error messages
