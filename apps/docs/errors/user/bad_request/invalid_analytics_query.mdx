## What Happened?

Your SQL query has a syntax error! The query parser found invalid SQL syntax that prevents it from being executed.

Common causes include:
- Missing or extra commas
- Unclosed quotes or parentheses
- Typos in SQL keywords
- Invalid column or table names

## How to Fix It

### 1. Check for Missing Commas

<CodeGroup>

```sql Wrong - Missing comma
SELECT
  api_id
  COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications_v1_v1
```

```sql Correct
SELECT
  api_id,
  COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications_v1_v1
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Match Quotes and Parentheses

<CodeGroup>

```sql Wrong - Unclosed quote
SELECT * FROM key_verifications_v1_v1 WHERE api_id = 'api_123
```

```sql Correct
SELECT * FROM key_verifications_v1_v1 WHERE api_id = 'api_123'
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Use Correct SQL Keywords

<CodeGroup>

```sql Wrong - Typo in SELECT
SELCT * FROM key_verifications_v1
```

```sql Correct
SELECT * FROM key_verifications_v1
```

</CodeGroup>

### 4. Verify Column Names

Make sure you're using valid column names from your analytics tables:

```sql
-- âœ“ Valid columns
SELECT time, api_id, outcome, key_id
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
```

## Need Help?

If you're stuck with a syntax error:

1. **Check the error message** - It usually tells you exactly where the problem is
2. **Test incrementally** - Start with a simple `SELECT *` and add complexity step by step
3. **Use a SQL validator** - Many online tools can help spot syntax errors
