## What Happened?

Your client cancelled the request before our server finished processing it. This happens when:

- Your client timeout is shorter than the processing time
- Network connection was lost during the request
- Your application cancelled the request (user navigated away, etc.)
- Load balancer or proxy terminated the connection

<Note>
**HTTP Status 499** is a non-standard but widely used status code that means "Client Closed Request". It was originally defined by nginx and is now used by many web servers to indicate when a client disconnects before receiving the full response.
</Note>

## Common Causes

### 1. Client Timeout Too Short

Your HTTP client may have a timeout that's shorter than our processing time. Make sure your client timeout allows enough time for the operation to complete (typically 30+ seconds).

### 2. Command Line Tools

Tools like `curl` or `timeout` commands may have short default timeouts. Use `--max-time 30` with curl or longer timeout values with other tools.

### 3. User Interface Cancellations

In web applications, users might navigate away or close tabs before requests complete. This is normal user behavior and should be handled gracefully in your application.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Increase Client Timeouts

Make sure your client timeout is reasonable for the operation (typically 30+ seconds). Check your HTTP client documentation for timeout configuration options.

### 2. Handle Network Issues

If you're experiencing network connectivity problems that cause your client to disconnect, check your network stability and consider increasing timeout values.

### 3. Check Your Infrastructure

If you're using proxies, load balancers, or CDNs:

- Verify their timeout settings
- Check if they're terminating long-running requests
- Ensure they're configured to handle the expected request duration

## When You See This Error

### It's Usually Not Our Fault
Status 499 means your client cancelled the request, so the issue is typically:
- Your client timeout settings
- Network connectivity problems
- User behavior (closing browser, etc.)

### Check Your Logs
Look for patterns:
- Is it happening at specific times?
- Are certain operations more affected?
- Are there network errors in your client logs?

### You Won't See 499 Errors in Your Client

**Important:** Since the client cancels the request before getting a response, your application typically won't receive a 499 status code. Instead, you'll see:

- Network timeout errors
- Request cancelled/aborted errors
- Connection reset errors

You can only see 499 errors in server logs, not in your client application. This is why this error mainly helps server operators understand why requests failed.

## Difference from Other Errors

- **408 Request Timeout**: Server took too long (server-side issue)
- **499 Client Closed Request**: Client cancelled early (client-side issue)
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: Upstream service timeout (infrastructure issue)

If you're seeing mostly 499 errors, focus on your client configuration and network connectivity rather than server performance.
