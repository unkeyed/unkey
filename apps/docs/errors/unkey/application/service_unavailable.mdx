## What Happened?

This error occurs when a component of the Unkey platform is temporarily unavailable or unable to process your request. Unlike an unexpected error, this is a known state where the system has detected that it cannot currently provide the requested service.

Possible causes of this error:
- Scheduled maintenance
- High load or capacity issues
- Dependent service outages
- Regional infrastructure problems
- Database overload or maintenance

Here's an example of a request that might receive this error during a service disruption:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v1/keys.createKey \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "api_123abc",
    "name": "My API Key"
  }'
```

## How To Fix

Since this is a temporary service issue, the best approach is to wait and retry. Here are some strategies:

1. **Implement retry logic**: Add automatic retries with exponential backoff to your code
2. **Check service status**: Visit the Unkey status page for updates on service availability
3. **Try alternate regions**: If Unkey offers region-specific endpoints, try an alternate region
4. **Wait and retry manually**: If it's a one-time operation, simply try again later

Here's an example of a robust retry strategy:

```bash
# Bash script with retry logic
max_attempts=5
attempt=0
backoff_time=1

while [ $attempt -lt $max_attempts ]; do
  response=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" \
    -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v1/keys.createKey \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
      "apiId": "api_123abc",
      "name": "My API Key"
    }')
    
  http_code=$(echo "$response" | tail -n1)
  body=$(echo "$response" | sed '$ d')
  
  if [ $http_code -eq 503 ]; then
    attempt=$((attempt+1))
    if [ $attempt -eq $max_attempts ]; then
      echo "Service still unavailable after $max_attempts attempts"
      exit 1
    fi
    
    echo "Service unavailable, retrying in $backoff_time seconds... (Attempt $attempt/$max_attempts)"
    sleep $backoff_time
    backoff_time=$((backoff_time*2))
  else
    echo "$body"
    exit 0
  fi
done
```

## Important Notes

- This error is temporary, and the service will typically recover automatically
- For critical applications, implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- If the service remains unavailable for an extended period, check Unkey's status page or contact support
- Include the `requestId` from the error response when contacting support
