## What Happened?

This error occurs when you attempt to use an Unkey API key that belongs to a disabled workspace. When a workspace is disabled in Unkey, all API keys associated with that workspace stop working, regardless of their individual status.

Here's an example of a request that would trigger this error:

```bash
# Request to Unkey API with a key from a disabled workspace
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v1/keys.listKeys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_KEY_FROM_DISABLED_WORKSPACE"
```

A workspace might be disabled for various reasons:
- Billing issues or unpaid invoices
- Administrative action due to terms of service violations
- At the workspace owner's request
- During investigation of suspicious activity
- As part of account closure process
- Exceeding usage limits or quotas

## How To Fix

If you encounter this error when using the Unkey API, you need to address the workspace issue:

1. **Check billing status**: If the workspace was disabled due to billing issues, settle any outstanding payments in the [Unkey dashboard](https://app.unkey.com/settings/billing)

2. **Contact workspace administrator**: If you're not the workspace administrator, contact them to determine why the workspace was disabled

3. **Contact Unkey support**: If you believe the workspace was disabled in error, or you need assistance resolving the issue, contact [Unkey support](mailto:support@unkey.dev)

4. **Use a key from a different workspace**: If you have access to multiple workspaces, you can temporarily use a key from an active workspace while resolving the issue

Once the workspace is re-enabled, all API keys associated with it should become usable again (unless individually disabled).

## Common Mistakes

- **Billing oversights**: Missed payment notifications can lead to workspace suspension
- **Usage violations**: Excessive usage or pattern violations may trigger workspace disabling
- **Administrative changes**: Organizational changes might lead to workspaces being temporarily disabled
- **Using old workspaces**: Attempting to use keys from deprecated or archived workspaces
- **Plan limitation violations**: Exceeding the limits of your current plan
- **Account transfer issues**: Workspaces may be temporarily disabled during ownership transfers
