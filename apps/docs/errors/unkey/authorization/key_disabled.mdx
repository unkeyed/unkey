## What Happened?

This error occurs when you try to use a disabled Unkey API key (one that starts with `unkey_`) to authenticate with the Unkey API. The key exists in the system but has been disabled and can no longer be used for authentication.

Here's an example of a request that would trigger this error:

```bash
# Request to Unkey API with a disabled key
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v1/keys.listKeys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_DISABLED_KEY"
```

API keys can be disabled for various reasons:
- Administrative action to revoke access
- Security concerns or suspected compromise
- Temporary deactivation during maintenance or investigation
- Automated disabling due to suspicious activity
- Usage policy violations

## How To Fix

If you encounter this error when using the Unkey API, you have two options:

1. **Get a new Unkey root key**: If your key was permanently disabled, create a new API key with the appropriate permissions in the [Unkey dashboard](https://app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys)

2. **Re-enable your existing key**: If you have administrative access and the key was temporarily disabled, you can re-enable it through the dashboard

To re-enable your Unkey root key:

1. Log in to your Unkey dashboard
2. Navigate to the API keys section
3. Search for the key you want to re-enable
4. Click "Enable"

Then update your API calls to use the re-enabled key:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v1/keys.listKeys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_REACTIVATED_KEY"
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Using old or archived root keys**: Keys from previous projects or configurations may have been disabled
- **Shared root keys**: When keys are shared among team members, they may be disabled by another administrator
- **Security triggers**: Unusual usage patterns may automatically disable keys as a security precaution
- **Environment confusion**: Using disabled staging/development keys in production environments
- **Account status changes**: Keys may be disabled due to billing or account status changes
- **Rotation policies**: Keys that should have been rotated according to security policies
