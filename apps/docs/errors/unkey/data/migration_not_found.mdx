  }
}
```

## What Happened?

This error occurs when you're trying to migrate api keys for a migration that doesn't exist in the Unkey system.

Common scenarios that trigger this error:

- Using an incorrect or expired migrationId
- The migration was deleted
- The migration belongs to a different workspace
- Typos in the migrationId

Here's an example of a request that would trigger this error:

```bash
# Attempting to migrate keys with a non-existent migrationId
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.migrateKeys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <UNKEY_ROOT_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "api_123",
    "migrationId": "migration_456",
    "keys": [{ "hash": "deadbeef" }]
  }'
```
