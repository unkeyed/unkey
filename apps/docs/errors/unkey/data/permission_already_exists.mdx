```

## What Happened?

This error occurs when you're trying to create a permission with a name that already exists in your Unkey workspace. Permission names must be unique within a workspace to avoid confusion and maintain proper access control.

Common scenarios that trigger this error:

- Creating a permission with a name that's already in use
- Re-creating a previously deleted permission with the same name
- Migration or import processes that don't check for existing permissions
- Duplicate API calls due to retries or network issues

Here's an example of a request that would trigger this error:

```bash
# Attempting to create a permission with a name that already exists
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/permissions.createPermission \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "admin",
    "slug": "admin-access",
    "description": "Administrator access"
  }'
```

## How To Fix

When you encounter this error, you have several options:

1. **Use a different name**: If creating a new permission, use a unique name
2. **Get the existing permission**: If you just need the permission information, retrieve it rather than creating it
3. **List existing permissions**: Check what permissions already exist before creating new ones
4. **Implement idempotent creation**: Use a get-or-create pattern in your code

Here's how to list existing permissions:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/permissions.listPermissions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{}'
```

Or implement a get-or-create pattern in your code:

```javascript
// Pseudocode for get-or-create pattern
async function getOrCreatePermission(name, slug, description) {
  try {
    // Try to create the permission
    return await createPermission(name, slug, description);
  } catch (error) {
    // If it already exists (409 error), get it instead
    if (error.status === 409) {
      // Extract the permission name from the error message and get it
      const permissions = await listPermissions();
      return permissions.find(
        (p) => p.name.toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase()
      );
    }
    // Otherwise, rethrow the error
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Not checking for existing permissions**: Failing to check if a permission already exists before creating it
- **Case sensitivity**: Permission names are case-insensitive - "Admin" and "admin" are the same
- **Retry loops**: Repeatedly trying to create the same permission after a failure
- **Cross-environment duplication**: Using the same permission names across development and production without proper namespacing
