title: Ratelimit Namespace Gone
---

## Description

This error occurs when you attempt to use a ratelimit namespace that has been deleted. Once a namespace is deleted, it cannot be restored through the API or dashboard.

## Error Code

`unkey/data/ratelimit_namespace_gone`

## HTTP Status Code

`410 Gone`

## Cause

The ratelimit namespace you're trying to access was previously deleted and is no longer available. This is a permanent deletion and the namespace cannot be recovered.

## Resolution

<Note>
Contact [support@unkey.com](mailto:support@unkey.com) with your workspace ID and namespace name if you need this namespace restored.
</Note>

## Prevention

To avoid accidentally deleting namespaces:
- Use workspace permissions to restrict who can delete namespaces
- Review namespace deletion requests carefully before confirming
