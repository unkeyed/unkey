## Error Code

`unkey/data/ratelimit_namespace_gone`

## HTTP Status Code

`410 Gone`

## Cause

The ratelimit namespace you're trying to access was previously deleted and is no longer available through the API or dashboard.

## Resolution

<Note>
Contact [support@unkey.dev](mailto:support@unkey.dev) with your workspace ID and namespace name if you need this namespace restored.
</Note>

## Prevention

- Restrict namespace deletion via workspace permissions
- Carefully review namespace-deletion requests before confirming
