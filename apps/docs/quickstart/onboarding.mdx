## 1. Create your Unkey account

The first step to using Unkey is to create an account. You can do this by visiting [unkey.dev](https://unkey.dev/app) or by clicking the Dashboard button in the top right of your screen.

## 3. Create your first API

Next we will get you to create your first API. This is the API that you will be protecting with Unkey. You can create as many APIs as you like, but for now we'll just create one.
