## Getting started

Once you have your Semantic Cache URL you can update your openAI SDK to use it by changing the baseUrl.

```ts
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://<gateway>.llm.unkey.io", // change the baseUrl parameter to your gateway name
});
```

Now you are ready to use our semantic cache! Unkey's semantic caching is free, supports streaming, and comes with built-in observability and analytics. In future we will offer deeper integration with Unkey's API keys for enhanced security and performance.


## Changing the Similarity threshold

If you need to be more lax or agressive with your similarity threshold you can tell Unkey by passing the `X-Min-Similarity` header. By default it is `0.9` but we understand you may have other needs.

```
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://<gateway>.llm.unkey.io",
  defaultHeaders: {
    'X-Min-Similarity': 0.92
  }
});
```
