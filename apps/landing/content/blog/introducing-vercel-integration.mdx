At Unkey, our commitment isn't merely about providing API authentication. We are pushing the envelope and strive to make things as simple as possible for the developer community. That's why today, I'm incredibly excited to introduce our brand-new **Vercel Integration**.

## What does our Vercel integration do?

The integration connects to your existing Unkey workspace and sets the necessary environment variables in your Vercel project. We allow you to set an Unkey API for each Vercel environment (development, preview, production) and automatically set the correct variables for you. The Unkey root key will be passed as a sensitive environment variable, which will not be visible in the Vercel dashboard.
