## Prewarming and Stale while revalidate 

Today Andreas focused on rewriting our cache to use stale-while-revalidate mechanics and prewarming when creating new keys.

As a result we now get:

- More cache hits
- Instant cache hits after key creation
- No stampeding cache misses when a cache expires

This means more performance for unkey without any extra work for you.
