/**
 * IPRules allows or denies requests based on the client's IP address,
 * evaluated against CIDR ranges.
 *
 * IP-based access control is a fundamental security layer, especially for
 * APIs that should only be accessible from known networks (corporate VPNs,
 * cloud provider IP ranges, partner infrastructure) or that need to block
 * traffic from known-bad sources. This is an adoption blocker for customers
 * in regulated industries where network-level access control is a compliance
 * requirement.
 *
 * When both allow and deny lists are configured, deny is evaluated first.
 * If the client IP matches a deny CIDR, the request is rejected immediately
 * regardless of the allow list. If the allow list is non-empty and the
 * client IP does not match any allow CIDR, the request is also rejected.
 * This "deny-first" approach ensures that explicitly blocked addresses
 * cannot bypass the block by also appearing in an allow range.
 *
 * When sentinel is behind a load balancer or CDN, it uses the
 * X-Forwarded-For header to determine the client IP. The rightmost
 * untrusted entry in the chain is used to prevent spoofing.
