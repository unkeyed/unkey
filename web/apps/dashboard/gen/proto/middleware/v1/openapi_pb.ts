 * OpenApiRequestValidation validates incoming HTTP requests against an OpenAPI
 * specification, rejecting requests that do not conform to the schema before
 * they reach the upstream.
 *
 * Request validation at the gateway catches malformed input early — wrong
 * content types, missing required fields, invalid parameter formats — and
 * returns structured error responses without the upstream needing to
 * implement its own validation. This is especially valuable for APIs that
 * are consumed by third-party developers, where clear validation errors
 * significantly improve the developer experience.
 *
 * Sentinel parses the OpenAPI spec once at configuration load time and
 * validates each incoming request's path parameters, query parameters,
 * headers, and request body against the matching operation's schema. Requests
 * that do not match any defined operation are rejected unless the spec
 * includes a catch-all path.
 *
 * Only request validation is performed — response validation is not
 * supported, since it would add latency to every response and is better
 * handled in CI/CD testing pipelines.
