Contributions are what makes the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. To ensure the best possible outcome for everyone, please read this guide carefully before starting work.

## Before You Contribute

To make contributing a great experience for everyone and avoid wasted effort, please follow these important steps:

### Public Discussion Required

1. **All contribution discussions MUST happen in public channels:**
   - GitHub Issues/Discussions
   - [Public Discord channels](https://unkey.dev/discord)

2. **Do not send Direct Messages (DMs) to team members about contributions!**
   - DMs will be redirected to public channels
   - This ensures transparency and helps others learn from the discussion

### Getting Started

1. **For Existing Issues:**
   - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
   - Comment on the issue to express your interest
   - Wait for a core team member to assign the issue to you
   - Only begin work after receiving confirmation

2. **For New Ideas:**
   - **Do not start coding immediately**
   - Discuss your idea first in our public channels:
     - Create a GitHub issue
     - Start a discussion in our [Discord](https://unkey.com/discord)
   - Wait for feedback from a core team member
   - Only proceed with development after receiving explicit approval

This process helps ensure your contribution aligns with our roadmap and prevents duplicate or conflicting work.

## House Rules

### Issue and PR Guidelines
- Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in [issues](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/pulls)
- Always create an issue before starting development
- Reference the issue in your PR using `fixes #XXX` or `refs #XXX`

### Approval Process
- All new issues get a `needs-approval` label automatically
- **What Needs Prior Approval:**
  - New features (large or small)
  - Refactoring work
  - Changes to core functionality
  - UI/UX changes
- **What Can Start Immediately:**
  - Bug fixes
  - Security improvements
  - Documentation updates
  - Typo corrections



### Prerequisites

There are no required services to run Unkey. Unkey has a built-in local auth mode with a permanently logged in user belonging to a single organization. Additional users, organizations, and multi-workspace features are not supported with local authentication.

To run in local auth mode, ensure you have the following environment variable set in your `.env` file:

`AUTH_PROVIDER="local"`

You also need the following tools installed.

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

#### Optional Services

- [WorkOS](https://workos.com/) - Authentication: If you need to work with multi-workspace scenarios, you must have WorkOS credentials within your environment file.
  - `AUTH_PROVIDER="workos"`
  - `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=<your client ID>` 
  - `WORKOS_API_KEY=<your API key>`
  - `WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD=<your base64 generated password>`
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - Billing: In order to work with multi-user workspaces, you need to have your Stripe credentials configured within your environment file to simulate a Pro plan to support features like inviting team members to your workspace.
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your Stripe secret key>`
