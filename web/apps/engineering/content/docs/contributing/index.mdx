Contributions are what makes the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. To ensure the best possible outcome for everyone, please read this guide carefully before starting work.

## Before You Contribute

To make contributing a great experience for everyone and avoid wasted effort, please follow these important steps:

### Public Discussion Required

1. **All contribution discussions MUST happen in public channels:**
   - GitHub Issues/Discussions
   - [Public Discord channels](https://unkey.dev/discord)

2. **Do not send Direct Messages (DMs) to team members about contributions!**
   - DMs will be redirected to public channels
   - This ensures transparency and helps others learn from the discussion

### Getting Started

1. **For Existing Issues:**
   - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
   - Comment on the issue to express your interest
   - Wait for a core team member to assign the issue to you
   - Only begin work after receiving confirmation

2. **For New Ideas:**
   - **Do not start coding immediately**
   - Discuss your idea first in our public channels:
     - Create a GitHub issue
     - Start a discussion in our [Discord](https://unkey.com/discord)
   - Wait for feedback from a core team member
   - Only proceed with development after receiving explicit approval

This process helps ensure your contribution aligns with our roadmap and prevents duplicate or conflicting work.

## House Rules

### Issue and PR Guidelines
- Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in [issues](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/pulls)
- Always create an issue before starting development
- Reference the issue in your PR using `fixes #XXX` or `refs #XXX`

### Approval Process
- All new issues get a `needs-approval` label automatically
- **What Needs Prior Approval:**
  - New features (large or small)
  - Refactoring work
  - Changes to core functionality
  - UI/UX changes
- **What Can Start Immediately:**
  - Bug fixes
  - Security improvements
  - Documentation updates
  - Typo corrections
