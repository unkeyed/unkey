Get up and running with Unkey development quickly. Choose your development path based on what you're working on.

## Getting Started

### Universal Prerequisites

You'll need these tools regardless of your development path:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Bazel](https://bazel.build/install) (build system)

### Initial Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey
cd unkey
make install
```

This sets up the Go workspace and installs all web dependencies.

---

## Choose Your Development Path

Select the path that matches what you're working on:

### **Path A: Frontend Development (Dashboard)**

**Perfect for:** Working on the dashboard UI, components, and frontend features.

**Setup:** Quick and simple - all backend services run automatically in the background.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Start Dashboard Development
    
    Run the local development setup:
    
    ```bash
    make local-dashboard
    ```
    
    This will:
    - Start required databases and services with Docker Compose
    - Create necessary `.env` files if they don't exist
    - Launch the dashboard development server
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What you get:**
- Dashboard running at `http://localhost:3000`
- All backend services running in Docker containers
- Hot reload for frontend code changes
- Simple, minimal setup focused on UI development

---

### **Path B: Backend Development (Go Services)**

**Perfect for:** Working on API services, backend logic, database schemas, and infrastructure.

**Setup:** Full Kubernetes environment with hot reload for Go services.

#### Additional Prerequisites

In addition to the universal tools, you'll need:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (for Go development)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) (local Kubernetes cluster)
- [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) (development orchestrator)
- [ctlptl](https://github.com/tilt-dev/ctlptl) (cluster management)
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) (local TLS certificates)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (recommended for easy tool installation)

#### Installation Options

**Option 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)**
```bash
make install-brew-tools
```
This uses Homebrew to install Minikube, Tilt, and ctlptl automatically.

**Option 2: Manual Installation**
Install tools individually using your preferred method if you're not using Homebrew.

#### System Requirements

The Kubernetes setup requires more resources:
- **RAM:** At least 8GB recommended
- **CPU:** 4+ cores recommended  
- **Storage:** 20GB+ free space
- Docker Desktop or similar container runtime

#### Depot Configuration (Build Service)

Unkey uses [Depot](https://depot.dev/) as part of the deployment pipeline during development.

**Current Setup (Required for now):**
```bash
cp ./dev/.env.depot.example ./.env.depot
# Edit ./.env.depot with your Depot credentials
```

*Note: We're working on making Depot optional soon.*

#### Start Backend Development

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Start Kubernetes Development Environment
    
    Run the full development setup:
    
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```
    
    This will:
    - Configure and start Minikube cluster
    - Launch Tilt development interface
    - Build and deploy all services to Kubernetes
    - Set up hot reload for Go services
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What you get:**
- **Tilt UI** at `http://localhost:10350` (unified development interface)
- **Services** accessible on localhost ports:
  - API: `http://localhost:7070`
  - Ctrl: `http://localhost:7091`
  - Krane: `http://localhost:8070`
  - Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Hot reload** for Go services (automatic rebuild on code changes)
- **Production-like** Kubernetes environment

#### Local HTTPS with Frontline (Optional)

To test the full request flow with TLS termination via Frontline, you can enable local HTTPS for `*.unkey.local` domains.

**Prerequisites:**
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) - for generating trusted local certificates
- DNS configured to resolve `*.unkey.local` to `127.0.0.1` (via `setup-wildcard-dns.sh`)

**Setup:**

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Configure Local DNS

    Run the DNS setup script to route `*.unkey.local` to localhost:

    ```bash
    ./dev/setup-wildcard-dns.sh
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### Start the Tunnel

    In a separate terminal, start the minikube tunnel to bind ports 80/443:

    ```bash
    make tunnel
    ```

    Keep this running while developing.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### Access via HTTPS

    Once Tilt is running and the tunnel is active, access your local environment:

    ```bash
    open https://app.unkey.local
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**How it works:**
- Tilt automatically generates trusted TLS certificates using mkcert on first run
- Frontline terminates TLS on port 443 and routes requests based on hostname
- The minikube tunnel binds the LoadBalancer service to your host's ports 80/443

#### Stop Development Environment

When you're done developing:

```bash
make down
```

This cleanly shuts down the Minikube cluster and cleans up resources.

## Environment Configuration

### Local Authentication

Unkey has a built-in local auth mode with a permanently logged in user belonging to a single organization. This is perfect for development and testing.

Set this environment variable in your `.env` file:

```
AUTH_PROVIDER="local"
```

### Optional Services

**WorkOS Authentication** (for multi-workspace scenarios):
- `AUTH_PROVIDER="workos"`
- `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=<your client ID>` 
- `WORKOS_API_KEY=<your API key>`
- `WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD=<your base64 generated password>`

**Stripe Billing** (for multi-user workspaces):
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your Stripe secret key>`

---

## Common Development Tasks

### Running the Unkey CLI

Use `make unkey` to run any CLI command with your local `.env` file loaded:

```bash
# General syntax
make unkey <command> [subcommands...]

# Run services
make unkey run api                    # API server
make unkey run ctrl                   # Control plane service
make unkey run krane                  # K8s management service
make unkey run frontline              # Multi-tenant frontline server
make unkey run sentinel               # Deployment proxy
make unkey run preflight              # Pod mutation webhook

# Seed data
make unkey dev seed local             # Seed local development data
make unkey dev seed verifications     # Seed verification events
```

For commands that need flags with `--`, use the `ARGS` variable:

```bash
make unkey run api ARGS="--http-port=7071"
```

### Seeding Local Data

Before running services locally, seed your database with test data:

```bash
# Start the database
make up

# Seed workspace, API, and root key for local development
make unkey dev seed local
```

This creates everything you need to start making API requests locally.

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code and run linters
make fmt

# Build all artifacts
make build
```
