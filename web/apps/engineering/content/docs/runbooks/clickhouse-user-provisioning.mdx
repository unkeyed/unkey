title: Provisioning ClickHouse Users
description: How to set up analytics API access for workspaces
---

This runbook explains how to provision a ClickHouse user for a workspace. This is required before a workspace can use the analytics API - the API uses these credentials to query ClickHouse on the workspace's behalf with proper row-level security.

## Prerequisites

- `ctrl-worker` running with `UNKEY_CLICKHOUSE_ADMIN_URL` configured
- Restate accessible

## Provisioning a New User

Call the `ConfigureUser` endpoint via Restate:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://restate:8080/hydra.v1.ClickhouseUserService/ws_abc123/ConfigureUser" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

That's it. The workflow will:

1. Generate a secure password
2. Encrypt it via Vault
3. Store credentials in MySQL
4. Create the ClickHouse user with row-level security

## Customizing Quotas

Override the defaults by passing quota parameters:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://restate:8080/hydra.v1.ClickhouseUserService/ws_abc123/ConfigureUser" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "max_queries_per_window": 500,
    "max_query_execution_time": 60
  }'
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `quota_duration_seconds` | 3600 | Window for rate limits (1 hour) |
| `max_queries_per_window` | 1000 | Queries allowed per window |
| `max_execution_time_per_window` | 1800 | Total query time per window (30 min) |
| `max_query_execution_time` | 30 | Single query timeout (seconds) |
| `max_query_memory_bytes` | 1GB | Memory limit per query |
| `max_query_result_rows` | 10M | Max rows returned |

## Updating an Existing User

Same endpoint. The workflow detects the user exists and updates quotas while preserving the password.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://restate:8080/hydra.v1.ClickhouseUserService/ws_abc123/ConfigureUser" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "max_queries_per_window": 2000
  }'
```

## Via Restate UI (Local)

1. Open Restate UI (`http://localhost:8080/ui` in dev)
2. Find `hydra.v1.ClickhouseUserService`
3. Enter the workspace ID as the key
4. Call `ConfigureUser`

## Via Restate Cloud (Production)

1. Go to [cloud.restate.dev/accounts](https://cloud.restate.dev/accounts)
2. Login with Google Auth → select **unkey** team
3. Get your API key:
   - From AWS Secrets Manager, or
   - Create one in Restate Cloud → Developers → API Keys

### Via UI

1. Find `hydra.v1.ClickhouseUserService` and click **Playground**
2. Enter your API key in the **Auth** section
3. Set `key` to the workspace ID in **Parameters**
4. Click **Send API Request**

### Via curl

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<environment-id>.env.<region>.restate.cloud:8080/hydra.v1.ClickhouseUserService/ws_abc123/ConfigureUser" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -d '{}'
```

Find `<environment-id>` and `<region>` in your Restate Cloud dashboard.

## What Gets Created

For workspace `ws_abc123`, the workflow creates:

- **User**: `ws_abc123` with encrypted password
- **Row policies**: One per table, filtering to `workspace_id = 'ws_abc123'` and retention window
- **Quota**: Rate limits on queries and execution time
- **Settings profile**: Memory and result size limits

## Troubleshooting

### "Service not found"

The `ClickhouseUserService` is optional. Check:
- `UNKEY_CLICKHOUSE_ADMIN_URL` is set in ctrl-worker
- ctrl-worker logs for connection errors

### "Quota exceeded" errors for user

Re-run `ConfigureUser` with higher quota values.

### Password issues

If a user can't authenticate, their ClickHouse password may be out of sync with MySQL. Delete from both and re-run the workflow:

```sql
-- ClickHouse
DROP USER IF EXISTS ws_abc123;
```

```sql
-- MySQL
DELETE FROM clickhouse_workspace_settings WHERE workspace_id = 'ws_abc123';
```

Then call `ConfigureUser` again to generate fresh credentials.
