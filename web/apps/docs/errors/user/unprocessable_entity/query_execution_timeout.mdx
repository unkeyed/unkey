## What Happened?

Your analytics query took too long to execute! We limit queries to 30 seconds to keep the analytics service responsive for everyone.

This usually happens when you're querying a large time range or complex data without enough filters.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Query Smaller Time Ranges

The most common fix is to reduce the time range:

<CodeGroup>

```sql Too Long
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM key_verifications
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR
GROUP BY toStartOfDay(time)
```

```sql Better
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM key_verifications
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY toStartOfDay(time)
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Add More Filters

Filter your data to reduce the amount of work the query needs to do:

<CodeGroup>

```sql Slow
SELECT api_id, COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications
GROUP BY api_id
```

```sql Faster
SELECT api_id, COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
  AND outcome = 'VALID'
GROUP BY api_id
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Use Aggregated Tables

For historical data, use pre-aggregated tables instead of raw events:

<CodeGroup>

```sql Slow - Scans millions of raw events
SELECT
  toStartOfHour(time) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications_raw_v2
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY hour
```

```sql Fast - Uses pre-aggregated data
SELECT
  time as hour,
  SUM(count) as total
FROM key_verifications_per_hour_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY hour
```

</CodeGroup>

### 4. Limit Result Size

Add a LIMIT clause to stop processing once you have enough data:

```sql
SELECT api_id, COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY api_id
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 100
```

## Need Longer Execution Time?

<Note>
**Have a legitimate need for longer-running queries?** Contact our support team!

[Reach out to support](mailto:support@unkey.com) and tell us:
- What you're trying to analyze
- Why the query needs more than 30 seconds
- An example of the query you're running

We'll review your use case and see if we can accommodate your needs.
