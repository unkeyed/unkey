## What Happened?

Your workspace has made too many analytics queries in a short period! We limit the number of queries you can run per hour to keep the analytics service fast and reliable for everyone.

This is a rate limit on the **number of queries**, not about individual query complexity.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Wait and Retry

The quota resets every hour. Wait a bit and try your query again.

### 2. Cache Your Results

Instead of running the same query repeatedly, cache the results in your application:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Bad - Queries on Every Request
app.get('/dashboard', async (req, res) => {
  // This runs a query EVERY time someone loads the dashboard
  const stats = await fetch('https://api.unkey.com/v1/analytics', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer unkey_XXX' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query: 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM key_verifications' })
  })
  res.json(stats)
})
```

```typescript Better - Cache for 5 Minutes
import { Cache } from 'your-cache-library'

const cache = new Cache()

app.get('/dashboard', async (req, res) => {
  // Check cache first
  let stats = cache.get('dashboard-stats')

  if (!stats) {
    // Only query if cache is empty
    stats = await fetch('https://api.unkey.com/v1/analytics', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer unkey_XXX' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query: 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM key_verifications' })
    })

    // Cache for 5 minutes
    cache.set('dashboard-stats', stats, { ttl: 300 })
  }

  res.json(stats)
})
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Batch Your Queries

If you're making multiple queries, try to combine them into a single query with JOINs or subqueries.

### 4. Use Webhooks Instead

For real-time updates, consider using webhooks instead of polling the analytics API repeatedly.

## Default Quota

| Plan | Queries per Hour |
|------|------------------|
| Free | 1,000 |
| Pro | 10,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

## Need a Higher Quota?
