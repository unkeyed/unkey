      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## What Happened?

This error occurs when you make a request to an endpoint that requires a request body, but no body was provided. Most POST and PUT endpoints in the Unkey API require a JSON request body.

Common causes include:
- Forgetting to include the `-d` or `--data` flag in curl
- HTTP client not sending the body properly
- Empty string passed as the body

Here's an example of a request that would trigger this error:

```bash
# Incorrect: Missing request body
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.verifyKey \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## How To Fix

Include a valid JSON request body with your request:

```bash
# Correct: Including the required request body
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.verifyKey \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"key": "my_api_key"}'
```

If you're using an HTTP client library, ensure you're passing the body correctly:

```typescript
// Using fetch
fetch("https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.verifyKey", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ key: "my_api_key" })  // Don't forget this!
});
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Forgetting the body entirely**: Easy to miss when copying curl commands
- **Empty body**: Passing `""` or `{}` when the endpoint requires specific fields
- **GET instead of POST**: Using the wrong HTTP method that doesn't support bodies
