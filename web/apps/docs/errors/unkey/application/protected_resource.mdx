<Danger>`err:unkey:application:protected_resource`</Danger>


```json Example
{
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "req_2c9a0jf23l4k567"
  },
  "error": {
    "detail": "The resource you are attempting to modify is protected and cannot be changed",
    "status": 403,
    "title": "Forbidden",
    "type": "https://unkey.com/docs/api-reference/errors-v2/unkey/application/protected_resource"
  }
}
```

## What Happened?

This error occurs when you attempt to modify or delete a resource that is marked as protected in the Unkey system. Protected resources have a special status that prevents them from being changed or removed, typically because they are system resources, defaults, or otherwise critical to proper system operation.

Common scenarios that trigger this error:
- Attempting to delete a default API or workspace
- Trying to modify system-created roles or permissions
- Attempting to change protected settings or configurations
- Trying to remove or alter resources that are required for system integrity

Here's an example of a request that might trigger this error:

```bash
# Attempting to delete a protected default API
curl -X DELETE https://api.unkey.com/v2/apis.deleteApi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "api_default_protected"
  }'
```

## How To Fix

Since protected resources are deliberately shielded from modification, the solution is usually to work with or around them rather than trying to change them:

1. **Work with the protected resource**: Use the resource as-is and build your workflows around it
2. **Create a new resource**: Instead of modifying a protected resource, create a new one with your desired configuration
3. **Use alternatives**: Look for alternative ways to achieve your goal without modifying protected resources
4. **Contact support**: If you believe you have a legitimate need to modify a protected resource, contact Unkey support

For example, instead of deleting a protected API, you might create a new one:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/apis.createApi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Custom API"
  }'
```

## Important Notes

- Protected resources are designated as such for system stability and security reasons
- Even with admin or owner permissions, protected resources typically cannot be modified
- This protection is separate from permission-based restrictions and applies even to workspace owners
- The protection status of a resource is not typically exposed in API responses until you try to modify it
