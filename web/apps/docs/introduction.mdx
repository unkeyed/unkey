title: "What is Unkey?"
description: "The API development platform for modern teams"
---

Unkey is the API development platform that handles the infrastructure you'd rather not build yourself: **API key management**, **rate limiting**, and **usage tracking** — all with global performance and zero servers to manage.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card icon="key" title="API Keys">
    Issue, verify, and revoke keys with metadata, expiration, and usage limits built in.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="gauge-high" title="Rate Limiting">
    Protect any endpoint from abuse — standalone or attached to API keys.
  </Card>
  <Card icon="chart-line" title="Usage Tracking">
    Know who's using your API, how much, and when — with analytics out of the box.
  </Card>

## Why Unkey?

WHY NOT???

Building API infrastructure from scratch means managing databases, Redis clusters, edge caching, and analytics pipelines. Unkey handles all of that so you can focus on your actual product.

| DIY Approach                          | With Unkey                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Set up key storage, hashing, rotation | `unkey.keys.create()`     |
| Deploy Redis for rate limiting        | `unkey.ratelimit.limit()` |
| Build usage tracking & dashboards     | Built-in analytics        |
| Manage infrastructure globally        | Globally distributed      |

<Note>
  Unkey never stores your API keys in plain text. We hash them before storage, so even if our database were compromised, your keys stay safe.

## What can you build?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="shield-halved" title="Protect a public API">
    Issue API keys to your users, verify them on every request, and automatically reject invalid or expired keys.

    ```ts
    const { meta, data } = await unkey.keys.verify({ key: "sk_123..." });
    if (!data.valid) return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="gauge" title="Rate limit anything">
    Limit requests per user, per IP, per endpoint — or any identifier you choose. No Redis required.

    ```ts
    const { success } = await limiter.limit(userId);
    if (!success) return new Response("Too many requests", { status: 429 });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="receipt" title="Usage-based billing">
    Track API usage per customer with credit limits and automatic refills. Perfect for tiered pricing.

    ```ts
    // Create a key with 1000 credits/month that refills automatically
    try {
      const { meta, data } = await unkey.keys.create({
        apiId: "api_...",
        credits: {
          remaining: 1000,
          refill: { amount: 1000, refillDay: 1 }
        }
      });
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
      throw err;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Multi-tenant rate limits">
    Use Identities to group keys under users or organizations, sharing rate limits across all their keys.

    ```ts
    // All keys for this identity share the same rate limit pool
    try {
      const { meta, data } = await unkey.keys.create({
        apiId: "api_...",
        externalId: "org_acme",
        ratelimits: [{ name: "requests", limit: 10000, duration: 3600000 }]
      });
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
      throw err;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
