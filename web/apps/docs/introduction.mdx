Unkey is the API development platform that handles the infrastructure you'd rather not build yourself: **API key management**, **rate limiting**, and **usage tracking** — all with global performance and zero servers to manage.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="API Keys" icon="key">
    Issue, verify, and revoke keys with metadata, expiration, and usage limits built in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rate Limiting" icon="gauge-high">
    Protect any endpoint from abuse — standalone or attached to API keys.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Usage Tracking" icon="chart-line">
    Know who's using your API, how much, and when — with analytics out of the box.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Unkey?

Building API infrastructure from scratch means managing databases, Redis clusters, edge caching, and analytics pipelines. Unkey handles all of that so you can focus on your actual product.

| DIY Approach | With Unkey |
|--------------|------------|
| Set up key storage, hashing, rotation | `unkey.keys.create()` |
| Deploy Redis for rate limiting | `unkey.ratelimit.limit()` |
| Build usage tracking & dashboards | Built-in analytics |
| Manage infrastructure globally | Globally distributed |

<Note>
Unkey never stores your API keys in plain text. We hash them before storage, so even if our database were compromised, your keys stay safe.

## What can you build?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Protect a public API" icon="shield-halved">
    Issue API keys to your users, verify them on every request, and automatically reject invalid or expired keys.
    
    ```ts
    const { data } = await unkey.keys.verify({ key: "sk_123..." });
    if (!data.valid) return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rate limit anything" icon="gauge">
    Limit requests per user, per IP, per endpoint — or any identifier you choose. No Redis required.
    
    ```ts
    const { success } = await limiter.limit(userId);
    if (!success) return new Response("Too many requests", { status: 429 });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Usage-based billing" icon="receipt">
    Track API usage per customer with credit limits and automatic refills. Perfect for tiered pricing.
    
    ```ts
    // Create a key with 1000 credits/month that refills automatically
    await unkey.keys.create({
      apiId: "api_...",
      credits: {
        remaining: 1000,
        refill: { interval: "monthly", amount: 1000 }
      }
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multi-tenant rate limits" icon="building">
    Use Identities to group keys under users or organizations, sharing rate limits across all their keys.
    
    ```ts
    // All keys for this identity share the same rate limit pool
    await unkey.keys.create({
      apiId: "api_...",
      externalId: "org_acme",
      ratelimits: [{ name: "requests", limit: 10000, duration: 3600000 }]
    });
    ```
