Audit logs capture every mutation in your workspace — key creation, permission changes, revocations, and more. They're essential for security compliance, debugging, and understanding who changed what and when.

## Why audit logs matter

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Security investigations" icon="magnifying-glass">
    When something goes wrong, trace exactly what happened and who was responsible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compliance requirements" icon="file-shield">
    SOC 2, HIPAA, and other frameworks require audit trails for sensitive operations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team visibility" icon="users">
    Know when team members create, modify, or revoke keys — especially in shared workspaces.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Debugging" icon="bug">
    Figure out why a key stopped working or when a permission was changed.
  </Card>

## What's captured

Every mutation is logged automatically:

| Category | Events |
|----------|--------|
| **Keys** | Create, update, revoke, delete, verify (failures) |
| **APIs** | Create, update, delete |
| **Permissions** | Create, update, delete, attach to key, remove from key |
| **Roles** | Create, update, delete, assign, unassign |
| **Rate limits** | Create namespace, update limits, set overrides |
| **Workspace** | Member added, member removed, settings changed |

## Accessing audit logs

## Reading the log

Each entry shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Time** | When the change occurred |
| **Actor** | Who made the change — a user (dashboard) or root key (API) |
| **Action** | The operation: `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, etc. |
| **Event** | What was affected: key, permission, API, etc. |
| **Description** | Human-readable summary |

Click any row to see full details, including the complete request/response payloads:

## Filtering logs

Use the filters at the top of the audit log page to narrow down:

- **Event type** — Show only key events, permission events, etc.
- **Actor** — Filter by specific user or root key
- **Time range** — Focus on a specific period
