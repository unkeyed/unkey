Root keys authenticate *your* requests to the Unkey API. They're used to create API keys, manage identities, configure rate limits, and perform other administrative operations.

<Warning>
Root keys have powerful permissions. Never expose them in client-side code, commit them to git, or share them publicly.
</Warning>

## Root keys vs API keys

| | Root Keys | API Keys |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Manage Unkey resources | Authenticate your users |
| **Who uses it** | You (the developer) | Your customers |
| **Permissions** | Create/update/delete keys, manage APIs | Access your API endpoints |
| **Where stored** | Your server's environment variables | Given to customers |

## Create a root key

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Settings">
Navigate to [Settings → Root Keys](https://app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys) in your dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Click 'Create New Root Key'">

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure permissions">
Give the key a descriptive name and select only the permissions it needs.

</Frame>

**Common permission sets:**

| Use case | Permissions needed |
|----------|-------------------|
| Verify keys only | `api.*.read_key` |
| Create keys for users | `api.*.create_key`, `api.*.read_key` |
| Full key management | `api.*.create_key`, `api.*.read_key`, `api.*.update_key`, `api.*.delete_key` |
| Rate limit overrides | `ratelimit.*.set_override` |
</Step>

<Step title="Copy and store securely">
<Note>
Copy the key immediately — you won't see it again. Unkey only stores a hash.
</Note>

Store it in your environment variables:

```bash .env
UNKEY_ROOT_KEY=unkey_...
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Use minimal permissions">
Only grant the permissions each root key actually needs. A key that only verifies API keys doesn't need `delete_key` permission.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use separate keys for different services">
Create dedicated root keys for each service or environment:
- `production-api-server` — verify and create keys
- `admin-dashboard` — full management access
- `billing-service` — update key credits only
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rotate keys periodically">
Even without a breach, rotate root keys every few months as a security practice. Create a new key, update your services, then delete the old one.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Never log root keys">
Ensure your logging doesn't capture root keys in request bodies or headers.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## If a root key is leaked

Act immediately:

1. **Revoke the key** — Go to [Settings → Root Keys](https://app.unkey.com/settings/root-keys) and delete the compromised key
2. **Create a new key** — Generate a replacement with the same permissions
3. **Update your services** — Deploy the new key to your environment
4. **Check audit logs** — Review [Audit Logs](https://app.unkey.com/audit) for any unauthorized activity
5. **Rotate affected API keys** — If you suspect API keys were created or modified, consider [rerolling](/apis/features/rerolling-key) them

<Tip>
Enable [GitHub secret scanning](/security/github-scanning) to get automatic alerts if your root key is accidentally committed.
