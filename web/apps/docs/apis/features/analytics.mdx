## Overview

Unkey Analytics provides a powerful SQL interface to query your API key verification data. Instead of building your own analytics pipeline, you can leverage Unkey's built-in data warehouse to:

- **Build custom dashboards** for internal teams or end-users
- **Power usage-based billing** by querying verification counts per user/organization
- **Generate reports** on API usage patterns, top users, and performance metrics
- **Monitor and alert** on verification outcomes, rate limits, and errors
