<Warning>
**Analytics has moved.** This page describes the legacy dashboard analytics.

For the new SQL-based analytics, see [**Analytics Overview**](/analytics/overview).
</Warning>

## Overview

Unkey Analytics provides a powerful SQL interface to query your API key verification data. Instead of building your own analytics pipeline, you can leverage Unkey's built-in data warehouse to:

- **Build custom dashboards** for internal teams or end-users
- **Power usage-based billing** by querying verification counts per user/organization
- **Generate reports** on API usage patterns, top users, and performance metrics
- **Monitor and alert** on verification outcomes, rate limits, and errors

## What's Available

The new Analytics platform includes:

- **SQL querying** of verification data
- **Time-series aggregations** (minute, hour, day, month tables)
- **Automatic filtering** by workspace and API
- **Custom dashboards** and reporting

<Note>
Analytics is currently in private beta. See [Getting Started](/analytics/getting-started) for access instructions.

## Legacy Dashboard Analytics

The dashboard-based analytics (per-API and per-key metrics) are being migrated to the new Analytics platform. For now, you can still view basic metrics in your [dashboard](https://app.unkey.com).
