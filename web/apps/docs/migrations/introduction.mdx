title: Migration Overview
description: 'Move your existing API keys to Unkey without disrupting users'

---

Already have API keys in production? Migrate them to Unkey without requiring your users to generate new keys.

## How migration works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export your existing keys">
    Extract key hashes from your current system (database, auth provider, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get a migration ID">
    Contact us to set up your migration and receive a `migrationId`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import to Unkey">
    Use the migration API to import your key hashes with their configuration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your verification">
    Point your API verification to Unkey — existing keys work immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why key hashes?

Unkey never stores plaintext keys. During migration, you provide the **hash** of each key, not the key itself.

Your users continue using their existing keys. When they call your API:
1. You extract the key from the request
2. Unkey hashes it and matches against stored hashes
3. Verification succeeds if there's a match

**Result:** Zero changes required from your users.

## What can be migrated?

| Setting | Migrated? |
|---------|-----------|
| Key hash | ✅ |
| Custom metadata | ✅ |
| Roles & permissions | ✅ |
| Rate limits | ✅ |
| Credits/remaining | ✅ |
| Expiration | ✅ |
| Identity/owner | ✅ |
