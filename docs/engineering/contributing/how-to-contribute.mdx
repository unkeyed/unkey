Contributions are welcome. To avoid wasted effort, follow these guidelines before starting work.

## Before you contribute

### Public discussion required

All contribution discussions must happen in public channels:

- GitHub Issues or Discussions
- <a href="https://unkey.dev/discord" target="_blank">Public Discord channels</a>

Do not send direct messages to team members about contributions. Direct messages will be redirected to public channels to keep context visible.

### Getting started

For existing issues:

1. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
2. Comment on the issue to express interest.
3. Wait for a core team member to assign the issue.
4. Start work only after confirmation.

For new ideas:

1. Do not start coding immediately.
2. Discuss your idea in public channels.
3. Wait for feedback from a core team member.
4. Start work only after approval.

## House rules

### Issue and PR guidelines

- Before submitting a new issue or PR, check existing <a href="https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/issues" target="_blank">issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/pulls" target="_blank">PRs</a>.
- Always create an issue before starting development.
- Reference the issue in your PR using `fixes #123` or `refs #123`.

Requires prior approval:

- New features

Can start immediately:
