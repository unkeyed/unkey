Unkey is async-first with teammates in multiple time zones. Minimize meetings and prefer async communication when possible.

<Note>
Always question if a meeting is necessary. If the information can be shared in a document or Slack message, do that instead.
</Note>

## No standups

Unkey does not do daily or weekly standups. Use async updates in `#daily-updates` to share progress or blockers.

## 1:1s

One-on-one meetings are personal and optional. They focus on growth, feedback, and issues, not status updates.

## Monthly all hands

Once a month, the team meets to realign, celebrate wins, and discuss improvements. Each person or team can add a slide with updates.

## Request for comments

RFCs can have a follow-up meeting roughly a week after posting. If questions are resolved asynchronously, cancel the meeting.
