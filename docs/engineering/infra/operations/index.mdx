## On-call

Content pending.

## Incident response

Incident alerts route through Alertmanager when observability is enabled. The observability chart can forward alerts to incident.io using the `incidentio` configuration in `infra/infra/eks-cluster/helm-chart/observability/values.yaml`.

## Deployments and rollbacks

Infrastructure deploys through ArgoCD ApplicationSets under `infra/infra/eks-cluster/argocd`. Each ApplicationSet renders a Helm chart from `infra/infra/eks-cluster/helm-chart/<chart>` with environment and region overrides.

Promotion files under `infra/infra/eks-cluster/promotions/<environment>/<app>.yaml` control the git revision used per app. `staging` tracks `main`. `production001` pins a commit SHA.

Roll back by updating the promotion file to a prior revision and syncing the ArgoCD application.

## Maintenance
