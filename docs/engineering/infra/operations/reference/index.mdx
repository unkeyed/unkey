## Configuration schema

Configuration is service-specific. Use the configuration pages under `docs/engineering/architecture/services/<service>/configuration.mdx` and the chart `values.yaml` for each service in `infra/infra/eks-cluster/helm-chart/<chart>`.

## Ports and endpoints

Services that use `pkg/runner.RegisterHealth` expose health probes on the configured HTTP server. The default base path is `/health`, with `/live`, `/ready`, and `/startup` endpoints.

The following services register runner health endpoints:

- API
- Control API
- Control worker
- Krane
- Preflight
- Sentinel
- Vault

Frontline registers runner health on an internal base path: `/_unkey/internal/health`.
