## SCIM limitations

SCIM provisions users but does not synchronize groups or group membership.

## Current solution

Unkey uses `ssosync` to sync Google Workspace to IAM Identity Center, but it has limitations:

- Workload Identity Federation is unsupported
- Service account credentials are expected from a file
- Upstream PRs have stalled

To map Workspace users to IAM Identity Center users, use the script in `unkeyed/infra/contrib`.

## Usage

### Basic usage

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=unkey-root-admin \
AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
bash unkeyed/infra/contrib/add-aws-user-to-aws-group.sh [username]
```

`[username]` is the `@unkey.com` user, for example `john.doe@unkey.com`.

### Adding to a specific group

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=unkey-root-admin \
AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
bash unkeyed/infra/contrib/add-aws-user-to-aws-group.sh john.doe@unkey.com aws-administrators
```

Available groups:

- `aws-administrators`: full administrative access
- `aws-users`: non-administrative access
