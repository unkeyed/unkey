## Access control

Service charts create Kubernetes service accounts and RBAC bindings by default. Review the chart `values.yaml` files to confirm service account names and any annotations you need for your cluster.

## Network boundaries

Ingress and service exposure are chart-driven. Review each chart for ingress and service settings before exposing endpoints to public networks.

## Secrets management

Charts integrate with External Secrets and AWS Secrets Manager when enabled. If you do not use External Secrets, provide equivalent Kubernetes Secrets for the environment variables listed in each chart.
