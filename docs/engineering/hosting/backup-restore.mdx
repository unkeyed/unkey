## Backup strategy

Backups depend on the data stores you run. Unkey persists data in MySQL and ClickHouse, and Vault stores encrypted material in object storage. Use the native backup tooling for each system.

## Restore procedure

Restore the backing stores first, then restart or re-sync the service deployments so they reconnect with restored data.
