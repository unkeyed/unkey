## Compatibility

Use the service-specific architecture and configuration guides under `docs/engineering/architecture/services/<service>/` for version notes and config changes.

## Upgrade steps

Follow the steps for your hosting model.

### Unkey-managed

1. Update the target commit in `infra/infra/eks-cluster/promotions/<environment>/<app>.yaml`.
2. Sync the ArgoCD application.

### Customer-managed

1. Update image tags or values in the chart `values.yaml` or environment override.
2. Deploy the updated chart.

## Verification and rollback

Verify health endpoints after the upgrade. Roll back by reverting the promotion revision or image tags and re-syncing the deployment.

## Release workflow

For Unkey-managed hosting, releases are driven by the promotion files under `infra/infra/eks-cluster/promotions/<environment>/<app>.yaml`. Update the git `revision` and sync the ArgoCD application to apply the release.
