Hosting covers Unkey-managed and customer-managed deployments. Use these pages to install, configure, operate, and troubleshoot Unkey in any environment.

## Hosting models

Unkey-managed hosting deploys through ArgoCD ApplicationSets and the Helm charts under `infra/infra/eks-cluster/helm-chart`. Customer-managed hosting uses the same charts, but you operate the cluster, secrets, and data stores.

## Audience

These docs target operators running Unkey in any environment, including Unkey-managed and customer-managed clusters.
