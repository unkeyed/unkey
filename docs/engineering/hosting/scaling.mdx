## Scale targets

Service deployments scale through Helm chart values. Most charts expose `replicaCount`, `resources`, and optional `autoscaling` settings. Check the `values.yaml` for each service chart.

## Capacity planning

Plan capacity around the backing stores you run for Unkey, including MySQL, ClickHouse, and object storage for Vault. Use service-specific configuration docs to align limits and requests with expected load.
