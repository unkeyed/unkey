description: "Ingress service for TLS termination and routing"
---

Frontline is the multi-tenant ingress service. It terminates TLS, routes requests to per-environment sentinels, and forwards cross-region traffic when needed.

Frontline is the first Unkey-owned hop for inbound traffic. It owns certificate selection and SNI routing and keeps short-lived routing and certificate caches to avoid round trips on every request.

Routing decisions come from the control plane data stored in MySQL. Frontline uses that data to select the correct sentinel for the target environment and to fail over when a region is unavailable.
