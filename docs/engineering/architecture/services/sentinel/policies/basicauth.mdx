description: "HTTP Basic authentication policy"
---

BasicAuth validates HTTP Basic credentials and produces a principal on success. Credentials are configured as static username and BCrypt password hash pairs.

## Fields

- `credentials`: List of username and password hash pairs.

## Runtime behavior

Sentinel compares the request's Basic credentials against the configured list and produces a principal with type `PRINCIPAL_TYPE_BASIC` when a match succeeds.

## Implementation status

BasicAuth is defined in the policy schema but is not executed by the sentinel engine yet.
