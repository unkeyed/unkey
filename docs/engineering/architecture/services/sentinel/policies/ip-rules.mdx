description: "CIDR-based allow and deny policy"
---

IP rules define allow and deny lists for client IP addresses based on CIDR ranges. Deny entries take precedence over allow entries.

## Fields

- `allow`: Allowed CIDR ranges.
- `deny`: Denied CIDR ranges.

## Implementation status

IP rules are defined in the policy schema but are not executed by the sentinel engine yet.
