description: "Request matching used by sentinel policies"
---

Match expressions define which requests a policy applies to. All expressions in the list must match for the policy to run. An empty list matches all requests.

## Matchers

Sentinel evaluates these matcher types:

- Path
- Method
- Header
- Query parameter

String matching supports exact, prefix, and regex comparisons. Regex evaluation uses Go's RE2 engine, and compiled patterns are cached for reuse.

## Semantics

- Method matching is case-insensitive.
- Header names are matched case-insensitively and can match any header value.
- Query parameter names are matched case-sensitively and can match any value.
