The `sentinel.v1.Policy` message is the unit of middleware configuration for a deployment. Each policy combines match expressions with exactly one policy configuration.

## Fields

- `id`: Stable identifier used for logs, metrics, and troubleshooting.
- `name`: Human-friendly label.
- `enabled`: When false, sentinel skips the policy.
- `match`: List of match expressions. All entries must match for the policy to run.
- `config`: One of the policy configurations, such as KeyAuth or RateLimit.

## Evaluation model

Policies are evaluated in order. If a policy rejects a request, evaluation stops and sentinel returns a structured error response. Unknown policy types are skipped for forward compatibility.
