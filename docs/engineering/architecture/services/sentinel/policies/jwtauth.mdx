JWTAuth validates Bearer JSON Web Tokens using JWKS or a public key and produces a principal on success. It centralizes token validation at the gateway.

## Fields

- `jwks_uri`, `oidc_issuer`, or `public_key_pem`: Token verification source.
- `issuer`: Required `iss` claim value.
- `audiences`: Allowed `aud` values.
- `algorithms`: Allowed signing algorithms.
- `subject_claim`: Claim used as the principal subject.
- `forward_claims`: Claims copied into the principal.
- `allow_anonymous`: Allow requests without a token.
- `clock_skew_ms`: Clock skew tolerance for time-based claims.
- `jwks_cache_ms`: JWKS cache duration.

## Implementation status

JWTAuth is defined in the policy schema but is not executed by the sentinel engine yet.
