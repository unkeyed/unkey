title: "Principal"
description: "Authenticated identity produced by policies"
---

`sentinel.v1.Principal` is the shared identity shape produced by authentication policies. It decouples authentication from downstream enforcement.

## Fields

- `subject`: The authenticated identity string.
- `type`: The authentication method that produced the principal.
- `claims`: Arbitrary key-value metadata provided by the auth policy.

## Header propagation

Sentinel serializes the principal to JSON and sets it on `X-Unkey-Principal`. The proxy handler strips any incoming `X-Unkey-Principal` header to prevent spoofing.
