Most Unkey API endpoints require authentication using a root key. Root keys provide access to Unkey resources based on assigned permissions.

## Bearer authentication

Use the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer unkey_1234567890
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "apiId": "api_1234" }'
```

## Security best practices

Never expose your root key in client-side code or public repositories. Use a backend server to proxy requests for frontend applications.

## Root key management

Manage root keys in the Unkey dashboard. Best practices:

1. Use different keys for development, staging, and production.
2. Rotate keys regularly.
3. Use clear key names.

## Key permissions system

Permissions are tuples of:

- ResourceType: category of resource (api, ratelimit, rbac, identity)
- ResourceID: specific resource instance
- Action: operation to perform

### Available resource types

| Resource type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `api` | API resources such as endpoints and keys |
| `ratelimit` | Rate limiting resources and configuration |
| `rbac` | Permission and role management |
| `identity` | User and identity management |

### Permission examples

Specific permission to manage a single API:

```plaintext
api.api_1234.read_api
api.api_1234.update_api
```

Wildcard permission to manage all rate limit namespaces:

```plaintext
ratelimit.*.create_namespace
ratelimit.*.read_namespace
```

## Authentication errors

If authentication fails, you receive a 401 or 403 response:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "req_abc123xyz789"
  },
  "error": {
    "title": "Unauthorized",
    "detail": "The provided root key is invalid or has been revoked",
    "status": 401,
    "type": "https://unkey.com/docs/errors/unauthorized"
  }
}
```

Common issues include missing headers, invalid key format, revoked keys, or insufficient permissions.
