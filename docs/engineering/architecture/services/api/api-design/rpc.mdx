Unkey uses an RPC-style API that focuses on actions rather than resources.

```plaintext
https://api.unkey.com/v2/{service}.{procedure}
```

Examples:

- `POST /v2/keys.createKey`
- `POST /v2/ratelimit.limit`

## HTTP methods

All operations use POST. This keeps request patterns consistent and allows complex request bodies.

## Request format

- Use POST
- Include `Content-Type: application/json`
- Include `Authorization` header
- Send parameters as JSON in the request body

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.createKey" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer root_1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "api_1234",
    "name": "Production API Key"
  }'
```

## Service namespaces

- keys
- apis
- ratelimit
- analytics
- identities
- permissions

## Benefits

- Clear intent in endpoint names
- Natural mapping to code and user intent
- Better support for complex operations
- Flexible request structures
