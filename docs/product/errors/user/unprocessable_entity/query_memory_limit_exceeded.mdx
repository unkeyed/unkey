## What Happened?

Your query tried to use more than 2GB of memory! We limit memory usage to keep the analytics service stable and fast for everyone.

This typically happens when you're selecting too many rows, using large GROUP BY operations, or performing complex JOINs without enough filtering.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Use Aggregations Instead of Raw Data

Instead of fetching all rows, aggregate the data:

<CodeGroup>

```sql Memory Intensive - Fetches all rows
SELECT *
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
```

```sql Memory Efficient - Aggregates data
SELECT
  toStartOfHour(time) as hour,
  api_id,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  AVG(response_time) as avg_response
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY hour, api_id
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Add More Filters

Reduce the amount of data the query needs to process:

<CodeGroup>

```sql Too Much Data
SELECT api_id, key_id, outcome, time
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
```

```sql Filtered Query
SELECT api_id, key_id, outcome, time
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
  AND api_id = 'api_123'
  AND outcome = 'VALID'
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Limit Result Size

Add a LIMIT to cap the number of rows:

```sql
SELECT api_id, key_id, outcome, time
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
ORDER BY time DESC
LIMIT 10000
```

### 4. Avoid Large GROUP BY Cardinality

GROUP BY on high-cardinality columns (like `key_id`) uses a lot of memory. Instead, group by lower-cardinality columns:

<CodeGroup>

```sql High Memory - Millions of unique keys
SELECT key_id, COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY key_id
```

```sql Lower Memory - Hundreds of APIs
SELECT api_id, COUNT(*) as total
FROM key_verifications_v1
WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY api_id
```

</CodeGroup>
