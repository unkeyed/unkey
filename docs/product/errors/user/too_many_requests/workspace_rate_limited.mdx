## What Happened?

Your workspace has been configured with an API rate limit and you've exceeded it. Most workspaces don't have a rate limit by default — this is only applied when needed.

The response includes standard rate limit headers (`RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset`, `Retry-After`) so your client knows when to retry.

## Need Help?
