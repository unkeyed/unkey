            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! üëãüèº

            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.
            Here is an example:
            ```
            <type>[optional scope]: <description>
            fix: I fixed something for Unkey
            ```

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```
      # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved
      - if: ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message == null }}
