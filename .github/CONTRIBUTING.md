# Contributing to Unkey

Contributions are what makes the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

## House rules

- Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in [issues](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/pulls).
- If there isn't an issue please *create one* before any development begins
- GitHub issues: take note of the `needs-approval` label.
  - **For Contributors**:
    - Feature Requests / Refactoring on a Large Scale: Wait for an Unkey member to approve and remove the `needs-approval` label before you start coding or submitting a PR.
    - Bugs, Security, Documentation, etc.: You can start coding immediately, even if the `needs-approval` label is present. This label mainly concerns feature requests.
  - **Our Process**:
    - Issues from anyone not on the Unkey team automatically receive the `needs-approval` label.
    - We greatly value new feature ideas. To ensure consistency in the product's direction, they undergo review and approval.


## Developing

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against.

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.
2. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git switch -c MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```
3. Follow our getting started guide in our [documentation](https://unkey.dev/docs/contributing/getting-started)
