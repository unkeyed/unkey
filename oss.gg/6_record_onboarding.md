**Side Quest**: Record your onboarding and first steps wit Unkey

Record yourself going through the setup of Unkey for the first time and provide feedback. Depending on how much feedback you provide, weâ€™ll assign 150 or 300 points.
You do not need to show your face if you donâ€™t want to but voice is required. Please say out loud what youâ€™re thinking or expecting as you go.

What should be included:
- Sign up
- Going through the onboarding
- Integrating Unkey into your app and either verify a key or use the ratelimiter

If you get stuck and can not do all of them, please report that. Thatâ€™s probably the best feedback you can provide.
