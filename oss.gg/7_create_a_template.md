**Side Quest**: Create a template of using some framework or language to build an API and protect it with Unkey


Create a minimal starter template to showcase how you can use Unkey with a particular framework. For example [Ratelimit your Next.js routes](https://www.unkey.com/templates/ratelimit-nextjs) or [Middleware for golangâ€™s echo framework](https://www.unkey.com/templates/echo-middleware).

**Requirements**:

- No duplicates, please check [unkey.com/templates](https://www.unkey.com/templates) first
- Must be open source, either committed to [github.com/unkeyed/examples](https://github.com/unkeyed/examples) or to your own GitHub account.
- Must be MIT licensed
- Must have a README.md including a quickstart for how to run your example.

**Points**: 750 points

**Proof**: Open a PR including the link to your repository.
